	The formulation of the shedule is one of the seven initiatives announced by the central bank in September 2017 to prepare Hong Kong to move into a new era of Smart Banking. The Framework - released after consultation with banks and service providers - takes aa four-phase approach to implement various Open API functions and lays out detailed expectations on how banks should onboard and maintain relationship with TSPs to ensure consumer protection. The HKMA expects banks to deploy Phase I Open APIs within six months and Phase II Open APIs within 12 to 15 months. It plans to publish a summary of deployment roadmaps of the Open API functions from the banks for reference by the market.To set an example, the HKMA has released its own Open API, comprising around 50 sets of financial data published on the its website, such as statistics on Hong Kong dollar exchange rates, interest rates, the banking sector and the Exchange Fund, as well as press releases and Coin Cart schedule. Norman Chan, chief executive of the HKMA, says: “Open API is one small step for a bank, but a milestone for financial innovation in the banking sector. We hope that the Framework will provide specific guidance to enable collaboration between banks and TSPs, and ultimately bring new experience of innovative, convenient and safe banking services to customers.”

	The new joint venture, Podium, comes amid a wave of disruption in the traditionally paper-based mortgage market which has seen a rash of new entrants in recent months.Moneysupermarket already attracts up to 16 million visitors to its mortgage website each year - representing around 25% of mortgage search traffic. Traditionally users find the best loan to suit their needs and complete the deal offsite with a third party mortgage broker. Podium's aim is to act as an onsite mortgage broker, digitising the application process and doing away with the paper trail.""We all know finding a better mortgage is complicated,"" says Moneysupermarket chief Mark Lewis. ""Customers are already looking to us for help with mortgages. We said we would do something about this and today we announce Podium, a new mortgage fintech, to build a comparison tool to bring customers the digitisation of mortgages - an easier and better way to arrange the mortgage that suits them.""Podium forms part of Moneysupermarket's 'Reinvent' strategy, extending the firm's remit into the provision of financial services. The group is midway through a £5 million spend to re-engineer its technology platform and unlock new opportunities for growth.

	Built on the back of Bloomberg’s natural language processing (NLP) techniques and available through the company’s Event-Driven Feeds (EDF) product, the data promises to allow financial firms to extract value by making sense of the over 500 million tweets per day.Tony McManus, Bloomberg Enterprise Data CIO, says: ""Our customers tell us that Twitter data is a vital part of their information-driven trading strategies, helping them uncover early trends and changes in sentiment.""Our Twitter EDF feed will help quantitative traders to capitalise on Twitter’s influence on the markets through constantly evolving curation methodologies. These include proprietary NLP modeling, coupled with Bloomberg’s reputation for data quality and the expertise of a world-class news organisation.""Separately, State Street has launched a mobile application that uses big data, machine learning and NLP to help investors assess their portfolio exposure to breaking news. The tool, called Verus, gathers coverage from thousands of major global, English-language news publications and combines machine learning algorithms with portfolio data from State Street’s end-to-end risk analytics platform to curate users’ newsfeeds. Humans also play a part, with Verus incorporating the insights of a dedicated editorial team comprising former financial news editors and journalists continuously providing feedback to the algorithms so that the connections made are relevant and that the underlying algorithms are continually improving.Once direct connections are identified, Verus analyses third-party relationship data in order to surface relevant indirect relationships within the portfolio. Connections are then ranked by a 'V Score' based on three main factors: article content, risk, and network connections. The V Score tells users whether they should care about the news and how much.Stephen Marshall, head, State Street Verus, says: ""About 150,000 articles are generated on business and finance topics each week, and investment and risk professionals struggle to reliably filter out noise and feel confident that they are not missing anything that could impact their portfolio.""Our new solution highlights not only the direct connections but also the less obvious indirect connections between these news items and clients’ portfolios; shortening the amount of time between when a relevant news story breaks and when a client can comfortably answer the question, ‘What is my exposure?’""

	Entrepreneur Tony Robbins, fintech fund CreditEase, and VC fund RX3 are among the new investors to pump $7 million into the firm, topping up a $5 million raise from March.Led by Walter Cruttenden, who co-founded micro-investing app Acorns, Blast has built an app that provides a way to save money by playing mobile games, based on in-game triggers set by the user. Once they have downloaded the app, users create an account and link their checking account to their Blast wallet. Gamers can then decide how much they want to save based on simple time triggers or more complex achievement triggers.Blast then boosts the money gamers put aside because the funds are held in an FDIC-insured account earning 1% APY. Gamers can also receive dividends for missions and win weekly cash prizes if they come in the top 25% of the app's leaderboard - with first place receiving $1000.The Android app works in the background of all mobile games in the Google Play Store and is also compatible with some PC games on the Steam marketplace with more to come. Blast has also started a waitlist for games on iOS, which launches in the autumn.Blast says that it wants to make saving exciting for younger people. During an eight week beta period, the average user’s account was up more than seven per cent.Says Cruttenden: ""It’s tough for most people to save money, so we created Blast to help people start accumulating wealth simply by doing what they already enjoy - playing their favorite games...Gamers tell us they feel better with the time they spend gaming when they know they are micro-saving or micro-earning in the background.""

	The USD Anchor stablecoin - a digital token that is backed one-for-one to the US dollar - has been launched by startup Stronghold on the Stellar Network, an open source protocol for value exchange. The token is backed by FDIC-insured US dollars with the reserves held by Prime Trust, a blockchain-focused asset manager.IBM says that it will explore uses for the Stronghold USD within business networks on its blockchain platform, looking for ways that banks and others can tap into the technology for better transaction processing. Stronghold says that its token can act as a new liquidity tool for real-time foreign exchange and international settlement, as well as enable banks to issue credit into transactional networks and trade ecosystems. By pegging to the dollar, the firm hopes to reap the benefits of cryptocurrencies while also limiting price volatility, adhering to the rigors and integrity of sound monetary policy, and providing support for industries that have regulatory compliance requirements.In a blog, Jesse Lund, VP, global market development, FSS - IBM Industry Platform, says: ""The “stability” of stable coins could translate into improving the entire backbone of international banking operations, giving banks an innovative way to significantly update their core banking and compliance infrastructure while also helping to improve operational efficiency and regulatory transparency; not to mention, these types of enhancements tend to greatly improve user experience and can help bolster a renewed trust in banks.""On the Stronghold tie-up, Lund says that it could let banks begin extending credit to real-time transactional networks - giving them access to new markets and allowing them to participate in financing activities like Open Account trade transactions.""There are still challenges to using stable coins, so this new solution will be explored further during a pilot period. The good news is that a successful implementation could be exactly what is needed for payments on blockchain to reach widespread adoption throughout the financial industry.""Welcome to the revolution,"" concludes Lund.

As we face into the challenges of Brexit, we are determined to pursue and seize new opportunities and the Government has, therefore, been making strenuous efforts to ensure that we have the right conditions in place in Ireland to attract the key knowledge-based sectors.”DTCC says it is now actively recruiting for several open positions, including a systems director and general manager.

Just today Mastercard was trumpeting a new deal with SIX Payment Services to enable the new Generali Arena football stadium in Vienna to go completely cashless, and in June, debit card payments overtook cash in the UK for the first time, spurred by the rising popularity of contactless and online shopping.

	Pay by Bank enables customers of UK businesses to make online payments for goods and services via their banking app, and directly from their bank account.The app was developed by Zapp, a unit set up by VocaLink in 2013 with the aim of bringing real-time mobile payments - in store, online and through apps - to millions of Brits by integrating its system into bank apps and tapping into the Faster Payments rails.The initiative signed up a host of big name retailers and banks ahead of a planned 2015 launch, vowing to win 20 million users by 2017, rivaling traditional payments giants such as Visa and MasterCard - which now owns Vocalink.Yet Pay By Bank has so far failed to live up to the hype and is currently still only available to users of Barclays' Pingit app.Mastercard sees Zapp as an important part of its Vocalink acquisition, giving it a new route into UK debit payments, currently a Visa stronghold.Pay by Bank will finally be made available to HSBC customers later this year, with others to follow. The new Worldpay deal will also see, from early next year, the service pushed to more merchants.Mark Barnett, president, Mastercard in UK, Ireland, Nordics & Baltics, says the app is ""set to play a big role in UK digital commerce, as more banks and merchants offer this as a payment option to millions of their customers"".

	The project - backed by ANZ, Bank of China, Bank of East Asia, DBS Bank, Hang Seng Bank and HSBC - had its first outing in March 2017 as a proof-of-concept (POC) and has since been pushed to an imminent live production date by the consortium under the guidance of the Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).Howard Lee, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, says: “This trade finance platform is the first large-scale multi-bank blockchain project in Hong Kong arising from the fruitful results of one of the HKMA's POC works on trade finance in 2017. I feel really excited about the development as it clearly demonstrates the HKMA's commitment in facilitating and driving the adoption of new and advanced technologies in Hong Kong.""Following a comprehensive tendering process, Ping An OneConnect Financial Technology has been appointed as the technological provider to the Platform and Deloitte as the consulting service provider to support its production deployment. The platform - which is is built on permissioned blockchain technology using Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 - is undergoing user acceptance tests, and is targeting a launch in September this year. The first product supported will be open account financing, enabling banks and their corporate clients within the ecosystem to submit and record purchase orders, invoices and applications for financing. The banks have also pledged to rope in more participants from banking and other industries, including logistics, into the ecosystem.The project is one of a succession of live deployments of distributed ledger technology and smart contracts in the labour-intensive, paper-driven trade finance arena, which is seen as a perfect testing ground for the introduction of a permissioned platform connecting the multiple parties involved in a single transaction.Vivek Ramachandran, global head of growth and innovation, commercial banking for HSBC points out: “The announcement is further proof that blockchain has the potential to digitize trade by eliminating inefficient processes and reducing the amount of unstructured paper.""More products are being primed for load onto the new system and handshakes with other projects across borders are also in the works.Says HKMA's Lee: ""The next major milestone of this project is to link up with other trade platforms in other jurisdictions to further facilitate cross-border trades.”The first of such connections was foreshadowed in October last year, when Hong Kong and Singapore dumped decades-old rivalry for trade flows in South East Asia and signed a fintech co-operation deal to foster the development of innovative financial technology across the region, beginning with a cross-border linkage of DLT-based trade finance platforms.

	According to data from Medici, the average sums offered for seed-stage companies in 2010 were $6.84 million, with $20.31 million allocated to early-stage VC rounds, and $26.64 million for VC rounds. In 2017, the average figures plummeted to $3 million for seed-stage companies but grew to $41 million for early-stage VC rounds and $1.566 billion for large-stage VC rounds.Medici says the data contains a stark message for entrepreneurs who are just starting out, pointing to anecdotal evidence of a 90% failure rate for bootstrapped startups. By Series A, the survival rate of US startups generally gets to about 40%, says the firm, to ~25% by Series B, and by Series D it drops to about 5%.""With 9 out of 10 startups failing, the one that becomes a hit has to be not just incrementally better than the competition but offer a 10X better experience"" says Medici. ""To become that one startup out of ten, a startup requires significant resource investments - time, talent - all of which comes down to money - to dive deep into understanding the market, performing research, building the product, testing, etc. None of that is possible without funding.""For the starry-eyed innovators out there, the silver lining comes from an exploding range of alternatives to VC funding, including multiple forms of crowdfunding, government-sponsored financing, and big bank venture funds, a trend which Medici refers to as the 'democratisation of startup financing'.
