I feel really excited about the development as it clearly demonstrates the HKMA's commitment in facilitating and driving the adoption of new and advanced technologies in Hong Kong.""Following a comprehensive tendering process, Ping An OneConnect Financial Technology has been appointed as the technological provider to the Platform and Deloitte as the consulting service provider to support its production deployment. The platform - which is is built on permissioned blockchain technology using Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 - is undergoing user acceptance tests, and is targeting a launch in September this year. The first product supported will be open account financing, enabling banks and their corporate clients within the ecosystem to submit and record purchase orders, invoices and applications for financing. The banks have also pledged to rope in more participants from banking and other industries, including logistics, into the ecosystem.The project is one of a succession of live deployments of distributed ledger technology and smart contracts in the labour-intensive, paper-driven trade finance arena, which is seen as a perfect testing ground for the introduction of a permissioned platform connecting the multiple parties involved in a single transaction.Vivek Ramachandran, global head of growth and innovation, commercial banking for HSBC points out: “The announcement is further proof that blockchain has the potential to digitize trade by eliminating inefficient processes and reducing the amount of unstructured paper.""More products are being primed for load onto the new system and handshakes with other projects across borders are also in the works.Says HKMA's Lee: ""The next major milestone of this project is to link up with other trade platforms in other jurisdictions to further facilitate cross-border trades.”The first of such connections was foreshadowed in October last year, when Hong Kong and Singapore dumped decades-old rivalry for trade flows in South East Asia and signed a fintech co-operation deal to foster the development of innovative financial technology across the region, beginning with a cross-border linkage of DLT-based trade finance platforms.

	To date, automation technologies, such as RPA, have been implemented by the financial services industry to drive down costs and create efficiencies. But a new front is opening, with the deployment of machine learning tools for customer-facing interactions seen as new weapon in the armoury of banks facing the threat of competition from Big Tech players like Amazon and Alphabet. Capgemini interviewed 1500 senior executives from 750 global organisations to draw out the benefits and challenges facing banks as they enter a new machine-learning era.The study found that, on average, over one-third of financial services firms have seen a 2-5% increase in topline growth from automation, with faster time-to-market and improved cross-selling efforts as the key factors that influence gains. Meanwhile, 64% of organisations from across different segments have seen improvement in customer satisfaction by more than 60% through intelligent automation. The report finds that more than half of firms (55%) are focused on increasing customer satisfaction through automation, while close to half (45%) see growing revenue as a key objective. Capgemini estimates that the financial services industry could expect to add up to $512bn to global revenues by 2020 through ‘intelligent automation'.Challenges remain however, with a dearth of talent and legacy infrastructures seen as key barriers to adoption. According to the report, only 10% of companies have implemented the technology to scale, with the majority of firms struggling with business, technology, and people challenges. Further, only around one in four has the technological maturity to implement cognitive automation technologies comprising machine learning, computer vision, and biometrics. Most organisations still have RPA, or - at best - Natural Language Processing (NLP), forming the backbone of their automation initiatives. Anirban Bose, head of Capgemini’s Financial Services Global Business Unit says: “The most visionary financial services firms have leaders with a sophisticated view of the potential impact automation can have throughout their business. And they are already reaping the rewards. Hundreds of billions of dollars in automation-generated revenue is up for grabs in the coming years. Only those companies that deploy this technology in a way that looks beyond cost cutting and focuses on creating value for customers and shareholders will be able to win in the marketplace.”

	Analysis of LinkedIn’s members based in the EU reveals that London is the number one city for European tech talent moving for work, with the capital welcoming more EU tech workers than any other European city last year. London was also the most attractive European destination for international tech talent from outside of the EU in 2017.Joshua Graff, head of LinkedIn UK says: “Since the Brexit result we’ve regularly analysed our data to help companies understand how it may impact their business as it relates to talent. It's clear that within the technology sector, London remains an incredibly attractive place for people to further their careers, develop new skills and find employment. We continue to encourage businesses to speak-up about why it's so important for companies to continue being able to seamlessly access skilled professionals from around the world. It's this diversity that helps British businesses thrive.”Separate research by global developer community Stack Overflow shows that London is home to more software developers than any other European city, with over 250,000 workers across the capital. Based on fresh analysis of Stack Overflow’s 50 million monthly users, London is the top European hub for professional developers, followed by Paris, Madrid and Berlin. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says: “It’s vital that London’s tech businesses continue to have unrestricted access to the best tech talent from Europe and the rest of the world. The best way to do this is for London and the UK to remain part of the Single Market and Customs Union, and I will continue to lobby the Government on this in order to protect our status as a global tech hub, while also investing in homegrown talent to ensure that young Londoners share in the benefits of digital growth.”The global appeal of London’s tech hub was further boosted by the news that 2017 was a record year for venture capital investment into the city’s tech businesses. In the capital's vibrant fintech sector, venture capital investment more than doubled in 2017 to reach $1.8 billion, with 54% of the total coming from overseas VCs.

	At the same time, the UK's leading banks have called for a special three year deal protecting the freedom of movement for financial services workers post-Brexit, according to a report in the Financial Times.
The worry about a tech skills gap was reported in a survey of 5,400 tech founders by industry body Tech London Advocates which revealed that more than a third had failed to complete prospective hires because of worries about immigration.
The report comes a day after the UK government announced a plan to double the amount of tier 1 work visas granted to ""exceptional talent""  to 2,000 a year specifically to quell any fears over a so-called Brexodus of highly skilled tech workers from Europe working in the UK or a failure to recruit any more in the future.
Announcing the measures, British prime minister Teresa May said she was in no doubt that the UK ""would remain a brilliant place to build a tech business"" post-Brexit.
But  some of the tech leaders invited to Downing Street to hear the plan told the Financial Times that the measures, while welcome, would not be enough and called for the visa plans to be extended, not least in the provision of tier 2 work visas for mid-ranking web and software engineers that are currently in short supply.
And Tech London Advocates founder Russ Shaw told the Financial Times that many startups also require administrative assistance when dealing with work visas and called for the rules around the recruitment of foreign nationals to be relaxed so that venture capital firms or tech incubators could sponsor some of the visa applications and thereby relief the pressure on both startups and the Home Office.
It is not just tech firms that are concerned about the personnel effects of Brexit. Numerous banks have warned about losing key staff as a result of post-Brexit immigration issues.
A report just published by industry banking body UK Finance, consultant Global Counsel and law firm Clifford Chance has called on the government to enshrine freedom of movement for financial services workers across Europe and the UK for at least three years following Brexit as part of a UK-EU free trade agreement that is “based on mutual acceptance of regulatory and supervisory co-operation and reciprocity”,
Britan's Brexit minsiter David Davis had referred to plans to negotiate a deal for the UK's financial services sector earlier this week and while UK Finance chief executive Stephen Jones told the Financial Times that the minister had been ""constructive"", he also called for more urgency saying that ""we are wasting time and need to start negotiating this now"".

	The comments, reported by the Financial Times, came from the bank's chief executive Sergio Ermotti who was speaking to reporters on a conference call in which he also expressed doubt about the viability of cryptocurrencies but much more support for the underlying distributed ledger technology.
But it was the CEO's comments on Brexit that garnered most interest. Back in January the bank's chairman Axel Weber had warned that more than a fifth of the 5,000 UBS staff employed in London could be forced to move as a result of Brexit.
The fears were downplayed by Ermotti though who said that the ""worse case scenario"" was looking ""more and more unlikely... because we also got some regulatory and political clarifications about what we need to do"". 
Ermotti did also say that the bank is clarifying its plans about where people will need and want to go once Brexit is enacted but the target is ""to keep as many people in London as we can"".
He did not give details as to what the aforementioned clarifications were but Ermotti's comments are likely to be welcomed by Brexit supporters who are keen to play down fears that the decision to leave the EU will lead to a job exodus. 
As regards the bank's blockchain plans, CNBC reported that Ermotti said he was not necessarily a beliver in cryptocurrencies, ""but I believe there is a future for blockchain technology, and technology will play a big role in changing and reshaping our industry"".
UBS is one of the partners in blockchain project Batavia, along with IBM and some other banks including Bank of Montreal and Commerzbank.
""Our strategy there is very simple,"" said Ermotti. ""We try to initiate and get as many other financial institutions and clients into teams like trade finance with other banks and IBM was a successful venture,"" Ermotti said.

	The survey, European Fintech Trends, showed the difference in the number and regional share of fintech deals among European countries and while the UK still leads the way with a 34% share, it has fallen from the 45% it enjoyed back in 2014.
France and Sweden have been the two biggest beneficaries from this drop, experiencing boosts of five and three percentage points respectively - France now has 11% of the deals while Sweden has 12%. 
That said, the overall capital raised by fintech-related ventures has increased in the same period. So far in 2017, venture capitalists have invested $2.6bn, surpassing the previous annual record and more than doubling the total raised in 2013. CBInsights forecasts that the 2017 total will exceed $4bn by year-end.
Nevertheless, the concern is that the UK is seeing its influence in the European fintech marekt diminish as a result of Brexit. A number of UK-based startups have highlighted the restricted access to the European Investment Fund, a large, EU-run source of venture capital, as one of the negative impacts from Brexit along with potential difficulties in recruiting skilled tech staff from overseas. 
The report also highlights a number of other fintech trends, such as the rise of insurtech where financing increased from $13m in 2015 to $129m in 2016 and looks set to rise further this year.
The report also showcases the growth of blockchain projects, many of them led by national governments in Sweden, ther UK, Ukraine and Estonia. Meanwhile, for private blockchain projects, Switzerland is emerging as a hub of choice within Europe. 
""Switzerland has proved itself a regulatory haven for blockchain startups, while the technology’s decentralized funding mechanism lends itself to borderless innovation,"" states the report.

	The figures are compiled in a report prepared by Oliver Wyman on behalf of lobby group TheCityUK. The data will form part of a pushback by the UK's financial services sector on recent Government sabre rattling over the terms of Britain's exit from the EU. With Government pro-Brexiteers clamouring for a clean break from European influence, Prime Minister Theresa May has warned that there will be no special favours for the UK's financial services sector as the UK negotiates its retreat from Europe.The Oliver Wyman data, developed with input from TheCityUK's Senior Brexit Steering Committee, industry participants, and the major trade associations, presents two distinct scenarios. It estimates that a Brexit where the UK is outside the European Economic Area but delivers passporting and equivalence - allowing access to the Single Market on terms similar to those that UK-based firms currently have - will cause only a modest reduction in UK-based activity. In this scenario, revenues are predicted to decline by up to £2BN (2% of total wholesale and international business), 4000 jobs would be at risk, and tax revenues would fall by less than £0.5BN per annum. Under conditions where the UK moves to a third country arrangement with the EU, without any regulatory equivalence and its relationship with the EU is defined by terms set out under the World Trade Organisation, up to 50% of EU-related activity (£20BN in revenue) and an estimated 35,000 jobs could be at risk, along with £5BN of tax revenues per annum. When taking into consideration the knock-on impact to the whole financial services ecosyststem - the possibility of shifting of entire business units, or the closure of lines of business due to increased costs it could almost double the effect of Brexit, says former FCA man Sir Hector Sants and vice chairman, Oliver Wyman.“Our work provides a robust and definitive fact base to facilitate the dialogue between the sector and policy makers,"" he states. ""It highlights that the impact of the UK’s exit from the EU on the UK-based financial services - and the jobs, income and taxes it generates - will vary dramatically with how much access to the EU is retained.""The UK financial services industry currently generates up to £205 billion pounds of revenue annually and employs 1.1 million people, according to the report.

	As the financial services sector scrambles to digest the implications of last week's referendum result, which saw the British people vote to leave the European Union, jobs and business are at risk.
According to Sky News, Visa may relocate hundreds of positions to the continent because of a clause in the recent multi-billion dollar acquisition of Visa Europe, which insists that transaction data does not leave Europe.
Citing sources, Sky says that German regulators are likely to push for Visa's UK-based data centre operations to be moved to an EU country. 
A Visa spokesperson told Sky: ""While we continue to monitor the situation carefully, it is premature to speculate on whether possible changes to the location of our data centres would make sense or be required.""
Several big banks - including Citi and Goldman Sachs - have already warned that they will move jobs to other EU cities if the UK does not get access to the single market's passporting regime.
Another potential Brexit casualty is the plan for a London headquartered post-merger LSE-Deutsche Bourse. Felix Hufeld, boss of German regulator Bafin, says that ""it is hard to imagine that the most important exchange venue in the eurozone would be steered from a headquarters outside the EU...There certainly has to be an adjustment here.""
Hufeld also says that euro-based trading could go through Frankfurt, which could also soon be home to the European Banking Authority, which will have to move its base from London because of Brexit.
French President Francois Hollande has also stepped into the euro clearing debate, saying: ""The City, which could handle clearing operations in euros thanks to the UK’s presence in the EU, won’t be able to do them any more.""
Last year the European Central Bank lost a court case that tried to bring clearing under its regulatory control by shifting it from London to a euro-area country. However, the Brexit vote may change the landscape.

	The global bank, which recently committed to a $17 billion tech spend as part of a new growth strategy, is currently recruiting for over 1000 digital roles including UI designers, digital product managers, software engineers, solution architects, exploratory testers and delivery managers.As the digital revolution progresses, however, banks will be on the hunt for people with an evolved set of skills, suggests the bank, specialising in up-and-coming applications such as virtual reality, predictive algorithmics and conversational commerce“Many of the roles and job titles of tomorrow are unknown to us today,” says Josh Bottomley, global head of digital, retail banking & wealth management, HSBC “One thing is certain, however - artificial intelligence will not replace human intelligence. Blending the best technology with the power of people will be the difference between good and great when it comes to customer experience.”To illustrate the changing nature of the workforce, the bank has pulled together a report with the aid of futurist Tom Cheesewright, analysing the challenges and opportunities facing the banking industry to predict six roles of the future:Mixed Reality Experience DesignerConsensus is growing that mixed, or augmented reality (MR/AR) will be our primary interface to the digital world in the future. Overlaying our physical world with a layer of digital data allows us to create any imaginable character or object and locate them in physical space as if they were real, and this technology will likely be used to carry out some of our banking needs in the future.Key skills: Designing these complex three-dimensional interfaces and making them slick and intuitive will be a major new employment area for the future, requiring skills in aesthetic design, branding, user experience and 3D mechanics.Algorithm MechanicA rising proportion of decision-making is made by algorithms, fed on a variety of input data to reach rapid conclusions. However, these algorithms operate in a fast-changing environment of shifting regulations, new information, and evolving products. Constantly tuning these algorithms to optimise banking customer experience, and avoid ‘computer says no’ moments, will be a skill in growing demand.Key skills: As we shift to a low-code/no-code environment for technology operation, this role will require skills in risk management, service design, and financial literacy, rather than technological proficiency.Conversational Interface DesignerMachines have become progressively more human in their interactions over the years. Chatbots are already used in banking to answer simple queries and gather information. Where instructions used to be complex strings of code, we can now speak to our machines and they will interpret our needs. Conversational interface design is an emerging skill to help us take best advantage of voice and text chatbots, and one that will only grow in importance as the technology becomes more mainstream.Key skills: Building natural, low-friction interfaces that go beyond solving immediate challenges to surprise and delight customers requires a mixture of creative, linguistic, and anthropological skills.Universal Service AdvisorThe separation between digital, physical and remote service environments is breaking down. At any moment a customer may want serving in a branch, via chat app, voice, or in augmented or virtual reality. As mixed reality becomes the main interface between people and machines, highly skilled service agents, empowered to support customers across a variety of products, will be able to switch seamlessly between virtual and physical environments from anywhere anytime to meet customer needs.Key skills: Critical skills for tomorrow’s customer advisor are a combination of product and domain knowledge with excellent customer communication and empathy. This will require a level of comfort with the key communications technologies, including performing in a virtual environment.Digital Process EngineerMany banking customer interactions - from onboarding to replacing a lost card - follow standardised flows that balance security and regulatory requirements with the desire for a slick customer experience. The rate of change of these processes is likely to increase, as is their complexity, as they combine service and information components from multiple sources. A digital process engineer analyses, assembles and optimises these workflows, adjusting them constantly to maximise throughput and minimise friction.Key skills: The digital process engineer will need great discovery skills, to understand large and interconnected workflows and diagnose problems and bottlenecks, and creative skills to help them to prototype and test solutions.Partnership Gateway EnablerIn an increasingly networked business world, the digital relationships with banking partners, like fintechs and global technology companies, will need careful monitoring, maintenance, and negotiation. With both cash and customer data potentially flowing between organisations, someone will need to keep a watchful eye on utilisation and conduct, as well as ensuring performance and regulatory compliance.Key skills: Gateway Controllers will balance technical knowledge of the digital interfaces with an understanding of security and risk management. Communications skills for partner engagement will also be highly valued.Each of the six roles will demand a core set of transferable skils, dubbed the three C's: Curiosity, Creativity and Communication.Says Cheesewright: “The role of humans and robots in tomorrow’s workforce has been hotly debated the world over, but the positive impacts of automation have largely been overlooked. Whilst machines will continue to take on the more robotic processes, increased emphasis will be placed on our ‘most human’ resources; qualities like curiosity, creativity and empathy will continue to set us apart from machines.”According to the report, lifelong learning and the need to upskill employees will become essential as the shortage of skilled candidates in digital and technology disciplines continues.“Employers have a huge role to play in helping people to continue their personal development, including working with existing staff to upskill them,” says Josh Bottomley. “We are embedding a culture that encourages our people to view everything through a digital lens, changing our mind-set from inside out so that we can deliver a better experience for our customers.”At HSBC, frontline employees in seven core markets have attend a weekly digital upskilling programme called ‘Digital Thursdays’, says Bottomley. The bank also has a Digital Leadership Programme, he adds, which helps senior managers have a greater understanding of digital trends and how these relate to customer needs.

	If, when the new rules come into force in September, the current three per cent settlement fail rates for collateral movements prevail, operational cost will quickly become a huge problem, especially for buy-side firms, says the paper, from DTCC-Euroclear Global Collateral and PwC.But the fail rate could actually increase, because the problems that cause them - miscommunication, constrained technology, insufficient collateral and counterparty insolvency - may be exacerbated by the complex changes that will be required to OTC derivatives workflows and documentation alongside increased margin call volumes.The whitepaper suggests that by 2020, the average annual operational cost of remedying bilateral OTC derivatives collateral settlement fails for survey respondents could rise 407% to $3.6 million for each buy-side firm and 377% to $2.4 million for each sell-side firm. Meanwhile, the number of full time buy-side firm employees will increase from four in 2015 to 24 in 2020. Sell-side firms on average, are predicted to increase from three employees to 16.Industry-wide unsupported exposure due to collateral settlement failure for sell-side firms alone is estimated to be $27 billion.

What used to take staff more than 45 minutes to complete (from the customers’ call, to checking of customers’ data, to recommending the appropriate housing loan re-pricing package to customer), now takes the robot just one minute. Staff previously had to execute 199 process steps, toggle across five systems and 27 screens, to process one housing loan re-pricing application, says the bank. The robot not only checks checks on customers’ eligibility to re-price, it also recommends appropriate re-pricing options, and drafts the recommendation email for customer. In total, the machine can handle as many as 100 re-pricing applications a day, significant improving on turnaround times for customer queries.The back-end production of sales report for management is also undergoing a robot revolution, freeing staff from the tedium of 166 distinct work-steps to calculate data housed in multiple spreadsheets.

	The WannaCry ransomware began infecting computers running Microsoft Windows on Friday and has already infected more than 200,000 machines in 150 countries, demanding Bitcoin ransom payments from victims including parts of the UK's National Health Service and FedEX in the US.
The ransomware uses an exploit developed by the US National Security Agency and is a particular threat to older operating systems such as Windows XP, which are no longer supported by Microsoft.
According to the Times of India, this has prompted the RBI to tell India's banks ""not to operate ATM machines until updates are in place"". However, while some ATMs have been shut down, a central bank spokesperson has since denied it has issued such an order, telling India Today that banks are simply being advised to run the updates.
Back in 2013, Microsoft warned that the Indian banking industry's reliance on Windows XP could put more than 34,000 branches at risk when support for the operating system ended. Yet, in February India's finance minister said that over 70% of ATMs were still running on XP.

	Cryptolocker - usually distributed through old fashioned e-mail phishing - works by encrypting the user's files on the infected machine and the local network it is attached to. Once encrypted, the computer displays a splash screen with a countdown timer and a demand for the payment of two bitcoins in ransom for the decryption key.
The ransomware has been sweeping the US and UK over the last month, counting the Swansea police department in Massachusetts among its victims. Swansea Police Lieutenant Gregory Ryan admitted to the Herald News that his department paid $750 for two bitcoins to decrypt images and word documents in its computer system.
The virus ""is so complicated and successful that you have to buy these Bitcoins, which we had never heard of,"" Ryan told the paper.
Meanwhile, Cryptolocker has been tweaked to take into account the soaring value of bitcoin. When the ransomware first appeared on the scene in September, a bitcoin could be bought for less than $200 but the currency is currently hovering around the $750 mark. Taking this into account, crooks have decided to give victims a break, deploying a new version of CryptoLocker which asks for just 0.5 bitcoins.
Separately, Rabobank has been accused of blocking the vast majority of its customers from buying bitcoins on the BTCNext exchange. According to a local press report, 99% of attempted transactions on Tuesday and Wednesday were blocked, with customers presented with a generic error code.
A bank spokesman told Nutech that the problem has been fixed. Although there is no indication that the bank has cut off access to the virtual currency, BTCNext's Pieterjan Goppel says that it is common for transactions to fail because they are often flagged over fraud concerns.

	BBVA will invest $250 million - including the BBVA Ventures $100 million - as a limited partner in Propel, which will use the money to invest in a US and European fund, putting cash into fintech firms from its San Francisco headquarters and a London office.BBVA took the then unusual step of launching its $100 million fund in 2013 and has used it to invest in digital lender Prosper, wealth management advisor Personal Capital and Taulia, an online cashflow management tool.Propel will now manage these investments and hunt out new opportunities, with a focus on early to late stage investments in firms working in payments, credit, insurance, wealth management, e-commerce, security and compliance.The new fund's managing partners are former BBVA Ventures managers Jay Reinemann and Tom Whiteaker, and newcomer Ryan Gilbert. Propel is also currently recruiting for its London office.With several banks now running their own fund, BBVA hopes that it can gain an edge and attract startups by working through an independent entity. According to TechCrunch, the BBVA Ventures fund was also restricted to investing a maximum of just five per cent in any round because it was structured as a small business investment corporation. This meant that large deals such as the recent acquisition of a 29.5% stake in UK challenger bank Atom had to be done through BBVA itself.Teppo Paavola, chief development officer, BBVA, says: ""In an increasingly competitive fintech venture capital environment, we believe that our increased capital, Propel's independence and a presence in London can enable us to invest in the best fintech start-ups and better support BBVA's vision of using technology to change financial services for the benefit of the customer.""

	Finextra joined a high powered session at The Clearing House Annual Conference in New York, in which no less than four bank CEOs declared that cyber, mobile, real-time, fintech and changing customer needs are all propelling technology to the top of the boardroom agenda.Innovations such as real-time payments - a hot topic throughout the conference as a result of The Clearing House’s initiative in this space - require banks to think differently about their expectations of ROI, the CEOs acknowledged. “We have to be able to do it today and wait for at least 10 years to get payback,” Moynihan said.His sentiments were echoed by Beth Mooney, chairman and CEO, KeyCorp, who added: “The use cases aren’t immediate, and we need to stay clear on having a vision for how to get there.”Partnering with fintechs is one way to achieve speedier, ‘plug and play’ innovation, suggested Bruce Van Saun, chairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group.William Rogers, chairman and CEO of SunTrust Banks agreed that fintechs have a lot to offer. “They were built from the customer backwards, and we can learn from that,” he said. However, as was reflected in other sessions during the conference, the CEOs were in no mood to overlook the initial aggression of certain fintechs - new spirit of collaboration or not. “We’re in a world where were are living in concentric circles and we are watching each other very carefully,” said Rogers. “The fintechs that come out and try to destroy us - they’re not our partners.”In any event, banks can’t rely on tech startups to innovate for them, the CEOs said. “You can’t absolve your management team from understanding what is going on out there, and partnering with a fintech alone isn’t the answer,” Moynihan told delegates. “We can’t outsource innovation to fintech partners,” agreed Van Saun. “It’s our responsibility to do things better.”In the wake of the Trump/Republican election win, the US banking industry is buoyed by a new sense of optimism, as bank stocks rise in anticipation of a period of growth. However, banks need to acknowledge the many uncertainties that still exist around the personnel and policies of the new administration, the conference heard, and they must continue on the strategic paths they have created in response to changing customer demands, the rising threat of cyber and the influx of new, customer-driven fintech players. KeyCorp's Mooney told delegates that the markets’ “constructive reaction to the election” is down to the fact it is “perceived as a catalyst. People are looking for something other than the status quo, and they believe that expected tax relief and regulatory relief will be a catalyst for growth.” However, she added, “bankers are conservative and we must stay on our path until we have a more substantive indication of what will change”. The priorities of the new administration are still not known for sure, pointed out Van Saun, while Rogers quipped, “A lot of uncertainty has been cleared, we just don’t know what.” There are also some fundamental contradictions to consider, Rogers said. The markets might think the election outcome is positive for banking, but part of the reason for that outcome is that “70% of US consumers are feeling financial stress”. As a consequence, banks need to be firmly in the “advice space”, he said. “We have to remember that everything emanates from the client, the community and the shareholder back - and what clients want is everything. Ubiquity in terms of access. A seamless experience across all access points. I firmly believe that digital and physical need to work together - and that every demographic assumption we make is wrong.”The CEOs agreed that stereotypes of millennials never entering a branch and older people never banking online are misleading - and also acknowledged the growing challenge of unpredictable consumer behaviour (as evidenced in the US presidential election and the UK Brexit vote). “Young kids won’t tell you what they’re going to do - they will just do it,” said BofA's Moynihan. However, all is far from lost, he said, due to the fact that “because our customers are always connected to us, we can have a constant dialogue with them”.The upside of further automation is significant, Moynihan implied, stating that 10% of Bank of America’s costs still go on pushing paper - cheques and cash - through the system, and he called on The Clearing House to help its community even further to leverage technology such as tokenisation to drive more efficiencies.Striking a cautionary note, he also highlighted the challenge of balancing innovation with resilience. “We are under pressure to innovate on the one hand, but not to innovate beyond the point of trust on the other,” he told delegates. Though banks are “uniquely positioned” to succeed here, failure isn’t an option, he said, “because if we lose the trust we don’t have the cost structures out there to redeploy non-automated means of doing business. We can’t not use the technology tools”.",10118,0,84

	The transaction involved international food conglomerate Cargill, a shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia via Singapore, and a letter of credit between the two banks issued on the Corda platform. 
According to the parties involved, the successful transaction demonstrated that trade digitisation via the blockchain is commercially and operationally viable. 
The trade finance industry is worth around $9 trillion annually and conventional paper-based, letter of credit transactions can involve multiple parties and take between 5 to 10 days. In contrast, this transaction was completed on a single shared platform and took less than 24 hours to be completed. 
“Trade finance transactions have been made simpler, faster, more transparent and more secure,” said Vivek Ramachandran, HSBC’s head of growth and innovation. “The need for paper reconciliation is removed because all parties are linked on the platform and updates are instantaneous. The quick turnaround could mean unlocking liquidity for businesses.”
The successful transaction was also welcomed by the other parties involved. “[Blockchain] is a key technology we are exploring and using with our own customers and, now, using for ourselves with the completion of this transfer on Corda,” explained Rani Misra, regional treasurer, APAC, Cargill. 
Ivar Wiersma, managing director, innovation wholesale banking, ING, said the project was testament to the power of ""collaboration with other ecosystems’ stakeholders like regulators, ports, customs and logistics providers such as large shipping carriers. And in particular, collaboration with other banks, even our peers"".
Meanwhile R3, the company which operates the Corda application along with 12 supporting banks, is looking to expand the use of the network as a utility for the trade finance sector, an industry which is still heavily reliant on paper-based documentation.
A number of banks and blockchain companies have looked to develop pilots and proof of concepts in this space in the last two years and it remains to be seen which ones will prove to be successful in the long-term given the multiple moviing parts associated with global trade transactions.

	The transaction involved a shipment of cotton from Texas, USA to Qingdao, China, executed over a private distributed ledger between the seller, the buyer, and their respective banks. The trade introduced a physical IoT supply chain trigger to the terms of the transaction to confirm the geographic location of goods in transit before a notification is sent to allow for release of payment. IBM has been using a similar cargo tracking facility aligned with smart contract distribution to improve efficiencies in its own supply chain network.Michael Eidel, executive general manager of Commonwealth Bank’s Cash-flow and Transaction Services, says existing trade finance processes are ripe for disruption. ""We strive to stay at the forefront of disruptive technologies to understand how they can be used to enable greater efficiencies and solve the real world challenges our customers face,"" he comments. ""The interplay between blockchain, smart contracts and the Internet of Things is a significant development towards revolutionising trade transactions that could deliver considerable benefits throughout the global supply chain.”Eidel's counterpart at Wells Fargo, Chris Lewis, echoes the comments but adds: ""This marks another step in evaluating technology that, over time, could support the evolution of trade finance.

	The consortium utilised the Linux Foundations open source Hyperledger software for the prototype app with IBM Research and Services providing technical and program assistance. The application mirrors a paper-intensive Letter of Credit (LC) transaction by sharing information between exporters, importers and their respective banks on a private distributed ledger. This then enables them to execute a trade deal automatically through a series of digital smart contracts. A report by Bain in July estimated that about 50% of banks' costs for a Letter of Credit arises from manual document handling and checking, which creates delays, errors and expense.Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC’s trade finance business, says: “Letters of Credit are an important part of the trade system, but they are based on 20th century technology, not 21st. Our challenge is to take this from concept to commercial use; making it quicker and easier for businesses to connect with new suppliers and customers at home and abroad.”He says the partners now plan to conduct further testing on the concept’s commercial application with selected partners such as corporates and shippers.Not to be outdone, bank-backed blockchain consortium R3 rushed out news of trials by 15 of its consortium member banks to use the Corda distributed ledger platform to process accounts receivable (AR) purchase transactions and letter of credit (LOC) transactions. Estimates suggest that such technology has the scope to reduce operational and compliance costs of paper-based trade financing by 10 to 15% and provide a platform for banks to grow revenues by as much as 15%.Over 15 R3 consortium members were involved in the trials including Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Danske Bank, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nordea, Scotiabank, UBS, UniCredit, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.

	In a letter responding to questions from the UK's Treasury Select committee chair Nicky Morgan, Visa's European boss, Charlotte Hogg, says that 10% of 51.2 million transactions across Europe were affected during the outage, which lasted from 14.35 on 1 June until 00.45 the next day.
In the UK, 2.4 million transactions failed to process properly, with 1.7 million credit and debit cards affected.
Explaining what went wrong, Hogg says that a component in Visa's primary data centre ""suffered a very rare partial failure"". This meant that Visa's secondary data centre was not able to kick in properly and automatically process all transactions. 
Explains Hogg: ""As a result, it took far longer than expected to isolate the primary site; in the interim, the malfunctioning system at the primary data centre continued to try to synchronise messages with the secondary site. This created a backlog of messages at the secondary data centre, which, in turn, slowed down that site's ability to process incoming transactions.""
Hogg also stresses that no money will leave cardholder accounts for transactions that were not completed, adding that Visa is working with UK banks to ""address the impacts of the incident, including appropriate compensation of cardholders"".
While technical steps have been taken to reduce the chances of a repeat failure, in the longer term Visa says that by the end of the year it will migrate European processing to its global system, VisaNet, which is ""more resilient in its ability to detect and recover from partial malfunctions of the type that impacted our European system"".
Visa looks set to escape further action from UK politicians, with Morgan replying to Hoggs letter: ""The Treasury Committee is satisfied with Visa’s answers regarding its system failure earlier this month, which lasted just over 10 hours and saw 2.4 million transactions in the UK fail to process. It appears that the problems have been fully resolved.
""The news that debit card payments have overtaken cash use for the first time shows that the reliability of IT systems is becoming ever-more important. The detriment caused to consumers by IT failures is greater than ever, so the Committee will become less tolerant of them.

	Under the definitive agreement, VocaLink's existing 13 bank shareholders are also in line for a potential earnout of up to £169 million if performance targets are met. Philip Hammond, the UK's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, welcomed the move, saying: ""MasterCard's decision to buy VocaLink shows that Britain remains an attractive destination for international investors. Britain is and continues to be an open and globally facing country in which to do business."" The deal comes just months after the UK's Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) said banks should sell their stakes in VocaLink to help increase innovation and competition in the nation's critical payments infrastructure.The London-based group operates BACS, the ACH enabling direct credit and direct debit payments between bank accounts, as well as the Faster Payments scheme and the Link ATM network. This means that it processes over 90% of salaries, more than 70% of household bills and almost all state benefits. Nearly every business and person in the UK uses its technology and last year the company processed over 11 billion transactions with a value of £6 trillion, generating revenues of £182 million.The PSR believes that the common ownership of VocaLink by a small number of banks is having a ""negative impact on innovation and competition in the industry"".MasterCard says that the acquisition ""accelerates MasterCard’s efforts to be an active participant in all types of electronic payments and payment flows"".In particular it means getting hold of VocaLink’s Immediate Payments System, which is live in Singapore and has won deals in the US and Thailand, and the Zapp system, which would give the card scheme a new route into UK debit payments, currently a Visa stronghold.Ajay Banga, president and CEO, MasterCard, says: ""VocaLink is a unique company with outstanding technology, assets and people. We look forward to investing in and maximizing the technology, and embedding it in our products and solutions, both in the UK and around the world.""David Yates, CEO, VocaLink, who will join the MasterCard management committee, adds: ""Today’s announcement is positive news for our partners, customers and employees. We will continue to focus on ensuring that the UK systems perform seamlessly, maintaining the highest levels of quality. At the same time, we’ll invest in further innovation to power competitive payments solutions for consumers and businesses around the globe.""The deal, which sees the current shareholders retain 7.6% ownership for at least three years, is expected to close in early 2017 and to be dilutive for up to 24 months after this.

Instead a token that lasts only for a few minutes and has no intrinsic value but represents the request and authorisation of payment, is passed between the retailer, Zapp and customer's bank.Zapp says that it is in talks with several major retailers about introducing the technology at the checkout and has already struck deals with major payment processors WorldPay Optimal Payments, Realex and SagePay.Trials for the e- and m-commerce features and a bill payment option are slated for the summer ahead of a full launch by the end of 2014.

Resolution of the alerts is 60% faster despite the volume of data, and the result comes at a fraction of the historical cost of such monitoring.The shake-up in the compliance function follows the creation in 2015 of an independent Compliance and Regulatory Affairs organisation (CCRO) reporting directly to the CEO.

Thanks to a combination of real-time processing and on-the-money monitoring, the bank is now able to perform KYC checks on international client transactions 80% faster at approximately 40% lower costs. Initially designed to spot patterns of money laundering, the algorithms deployed on the platform are now being adapted to detect fraud and monitor transactions, says Warner. Credit Suisse has also been deploying an army of software robots to carry out certain repetitive compliance tasks. One of them, dubbed 'James the Robot', is used for suitability and appropriateness checks - to ensure clients are invested in the right products. James conducts these checks 200 times faster than when they were done manually, representing a significant reduction in risk for the bank.In a statement, the bank says: ""After three years of rising compliance costs at Credit Suisse, due both to new regulation and investment in technology, the deployment of the new platform and the use of data analytics in 2017 has turned the tide.""

Cryan did not elaborate on how many of the bank's 100,000 staff may lose their jobs to a robotic rival, other than to say it would be ""a big number"". And he hinted that those accountants acting like abacuses were most at risk. ""The truthful answer is we won’t need as many people…In our banks we have people behaving like robots doing mechanical things, tomorrow we’re going to have robots behaving like people.""Cryan's comments come in the middle of a long-running cost-cutting exercise at the bank. In addiiton to overhauling its IT structure, the bank has also announced a number of job cuts and branch closures.Although, on a more positive note, the Deutsche Bank chief executive did add that the use of new technology and robots would not always be a direct replacement for human staff.Instead some staff would be ""upskilled"" and given more interesting work as the more commoditised tasks were entrusted to automation and robots.Cryan is not the only figure to warn about the possible impact of robotics and artificial intelligence on employment in the banking sector. A 2016 report from the World Economic Forum predicted that auotmation would result in the loss of 5 million jobs by 2020.

,RECONCILIATION,REFERENCE DATA",1500638400,"Robots, artificial intelligence and other forms of automation could take over almost a third of investment banking jobs within just a few years, according to a recent report from consultant McKinsey. 
	The report, Cognitive Technologies in Capital Markets, examines which jobs and processes within the corporate and investment banking world are most suited to automated technologies. It concludes that 60% of jobs will face a big impact from artificial intelligence and robotics while 30% of jobs could be performed entirely via automation.
While this may be disturbing news for investment bankers worried that they will become surplus to requirements, the report states that this shift in work practices will not just lead to job cuts but should also free up staff to perform more high-value tasks.
""The application of cognitive technologies to capital markets functions can reduce budgets and free up capacity for teams to focus on higher-value activities such as research, idea generation and client relationship management,"" states the report.
In terms of those processes most ripe for automation, the report picks out trade allocation as its number one, stating that the auto-population of trade details is already being piloted by a number of investment banks.
The report separates middle office, finance and operations tasks in its examination of what is most appropriate for automation and states that the latter group will enjoy greater employee capacity from the use of cognitive technology, especially a number of post-trade processes such as settlement/payments, confirmations and reconciliations.
It also states that ""pockets of value will be delivered across the business, from risk management to compliance and HR"". However there is little focus on the front office and the role of traders and dealmakers.
In terms of the technology, McKinsey states that machine learning will have the greatest impact, while consumer-facing robots or cognitive agents will have the lowest overall impact.
The report states that the technology will be ready to move to ""centre stage"" within two or three years but it also warns that it will not magically produce double digit growth for banks. It will though make banks more efficient and better able to respond to technology changes and recommends that they establish internal departments or centres to track emerging technology and encourage greater innovation.
The majority of investment banks have already set up a number of so-called innovation centres and started to pilot the use of cognitive technologies for some processes. And a number of bank heads have also sought to assure staff that the introduction of machine learning, robots and the like will not necessarily result in headcount reduction.
For example, the world's biggest bank JP Morgan stated its intention to use robotics and machine learning to automate basic manual tasks in its annual letter to shareholders back in April but the bank's boss Jamie Dimon also said in June that he expects headcount at the bank to go up despite automation.
“We’re using bots today, it’s not going to stop us from opening retail branches” or hiring private bankers or expanding in Africa, he said in an interview published on LinkedIn. “My guess is our headcount will go up over the next 20 years, not down.”

	Portfolio managers are having to take into account an ever-growing deluge of information from not only analyst reports, but also numerous news sources, industry blogs and social media, to make forecasts and determine the impact on stock prices. Working with Nomura Research Institute, NAM spent months on a proof-of-concept to see whether natural language processing utilising AI could increase the accuracy of portfolio managers’ investment decision-making. The firms used AI technology to analyse all the information a portfolio manager would consume and score them into two groups - either positive (indicating that company performance or corporate value is likely to rise) or negative (is unlikely to rise).First up, a natural language analysis on analyst reports was done to highlight the shifts of investment decisions; for example, a shift from neutral to overweight or from neutral to underweight. The language patterns for 'positive' and 'negative' were then identified and used as training data for AI. Finally, the AI calculated the similarities between the training data and the targeted materials, scoring whether each piece of information was 'positive' or 'negative'.NAM says that the PoC highlighted that analysis of analyst reports using AI enabled the quantitative assessment of information which portfolio managers usually see as qualitative. In addition, even text information from news websites and blogs could be quantitatively scored and used to boost the ability of portfolio managers to make investment decisions. The partners now plan to work with clients to create more PoCs and to explore cases where AI can help portfolio managers in their work.

The firm estimates that a third of the jobs lost to machines will be replaced by technology and data providers serving the industry’s new needs, creating close to 30,000 new jobs at technology and data providers. The uptick in spending on AI-related technologies - including robotic process automation, machine learning, and cognitive analytics - is already evident, with $1.5 billion expected to be allocated across the banking industry over the next year, rising 75% to $2.8 billion by 2021. Bank investment in the technology is likely to reinforce current power structures, believes Opimas, creating a formidable barrier to entry for new startups.""Since they need access to vast amounts of data to efficiently train an AI system, banks have a clear advantage over potential new entrants because they can leverage their huge internal data sets,"" says the report.

	Speaking at Mobey Day in Toronto, IBM associate partner Pavel Abdur-Rahman moved to cool some of the hype surrounding AI, arguing that it is not going to be seen in a true sense until quantum computing takes off more than a decade down the line. However, the data scientist was keen to show off the capabilities of Big Blue's cognitive computing platform, Watson, and what this means for the financial services industry.Abdur-Rahman ran through seven ways in which Watson can help banks, ranging from the simple, such as a chatbot acting as a virtual assistant answering basic customer queries, to the ""quite complex"", including looking for patterns in unstructured data to find early signals of opportunities and risks for asset managers building portfolios.Watson caused a stir in 2011 when it beat two human competitors to claim the $1 million prize on the US quiz show Jeopardy. Since then several banks, including Standard Bank, USAA, DBS Bank, ANZ and Royal Bank of Canada have been attempting to take the platform out of the TV studio and into the real world, harnessing its power for a variety of tasks. One major area that IBM expects the technology to come into its own is compliance. In September the firm revealed plans to buy risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm Promontory Capital and create a new subsidiary, Watson Financial Services, in which it will use artificial intelligence technology to keep pace with the rapidly changing financial reporting landscape. IBM says it will combine the expertise of Promontory's 600 staffers with Watson's cognitive computing abilities to directly address the massive operational effort and manual cost of escalating regulation and risk management requirements.Another area where Watson is seen as a potential gamechanger is wealth management. At Mobey Day, Abdur-Rahman suggested that augmented intelligence has the potential to make wealth management far more efficient but was at pains to note that human input and judgement will still be a vital component of any good service.He had little time for the dystopian view of intelligent robots putting dumb humans out of business, paraphrasing an academic who argues that we should use robots to make people's jobs less robotic by freeing them of repetitive tasks.Mobile wallet war storiesElsewhere at Mobey Day there were some warnings from history for the crowd of mobile money enthusiasts. Speaking on a panel of veterans, Kai Johnson, who worked on the failed US telco JV Softcard and Jeppe Dorff from the similar, and similarly failed, Suretap in Canada, made no secret of their exasperation.Johnson painted a picture of an organisation that failed to get merchants onboard or customers interested, and which suffered at the hands of its own owners, who undermined themselves from the inside by being unable to stop trying to compete with their partners. Noting that even the mighty Apple has so far failed to make a success of mobile payments, Johnson and Dorff were in agreement that while the technological problems may now have been addressed, the collaboration hurdles have not.Around the world, mobile network operators are abandoning their payments ambitions, a move that may prove smart if the comments of Scotiabank's Tom Pawelkiewicz are any indication. During a separate panel, Pawelkiewicz confirmed that for all the buzz, his bank couldn't claim to have won over a single new customer with its mobile wallet.However, providing some comfort to attendees was Kasper Sylvest from Danske Bank, which runs the incredibly successful MobilePay service in Denmark. As others looked on enviously, Sylvest rattled off the numbers: there are 5.5 million people in Denmark, of which four million could use MobilePay and 3.5 million do - for everything from P2P payments to instore transactions to buying virtual stamps for sending old-fashioned letters.The services is so successful that rival Nordea has finally bowed to the inevitable, giving up on its Swipp alternative - despite only recently buying another failed MNO-backed option to help it fight Danske - and hitching its wagon to MobilePay, an unambiguous mobile wallet success story.

	Like many people who were young in 1997, I had a Tamagotchi and it meant the world to me. Whenever it was hungry, I hurried to feed my digital pet. If it beeped about being lonely, I'd go give it attention. My parents thought it was a little silly to be that devoted to a toy, but in this day and age it's almost impossible to imagine life without interaction between man and machine. It’s a trend that’s here to stay.Today's virtual sidekicks have come a long way, compared to my substitute pet of twenty years ago. Siri stands at the ready to search the whole web for you and even makes the occasional pre-programmed quip. Alexa understands what you're saying and uses a connection with your bank to transfer money as requested. Even your car can be linked to your digital personal assistant by Amazon, allowing you to remotely lock your vehicle and showing you your fuel levels at any time. Then there's Penny, a mobile app with an avatar by the same name which can maintain a natural dialogue about your income and expenses. Nice little detail: Penny uses emoticons just like a real person.As basic or highly advanced as they come, digital assistants are being introduced to many areas of life. Most of them don't pick up on our emotional signals just yet. The MoodBox is an exception; it selects and plays music for you based on the emotion in your voice, and tops it off with sympathetic reactions. Amazon is developing an update for Alexa which will enable it to notice if you sound bothered, and adjust its answers accordingly. Not only are these tools becoming incrementally clever with each update and new generation, they're also turning more and more human in the process. Even artistic creativity doesn't seem to be a human-only trait anymore, now that the first computer-generated tunes, paintings, and novels are being released.We have not yet developed a computer that can simulate all cognitive, emotional, and creative abilities that humans possess. However, artificial intelligence is already seeing interesting applications in various areas of life. In the financial world, we divide them into two types of virtual assistants: those that help bank employees do their work more efficiently, and those that directly interact with clients.Smarter with each conversationWe've already implemented many features that fit into the latter category. A chatbot on the SwedBank website answers all visitor questions, and challenger bank Atom uses an app with a virtual agent who gets smarter with each conversation. And recently, during Startup Friday, we showcased a prototype of a new chatbot that tells you, after you answer a set of questions, what your maximum mortgage is. These assistants don't always have to come equipped with a face and a personality. Some digital assistants are simply smart apps, such as ABN AMRO's Grip which offers insight into your income and expenses.The bank employee, too, benefits from the help of digital assistants. Imagine a dashboard for the relationship manager with a one-page overview, listing clients that need advice and their related financial needs. Or a virtual robot that picks up the monotonous and time-consuming tasks. Another application is a fraud detection system that traces subtle changes in transaction patterns. Digital assistants can run risk analyses that eliminate gut feeling, and rely purely on advanced data analysis.No matter which way you look at it, Artificial Intelligence can help companies provide customers with even better service. Directly by means of chatbots and smart apps, or indirectly by empowering employees and freeing up their time and headspace. When it comes to services we've already automated, we provide our clients with a personal touch in virtual form. Other services, with human contact at their core, receive a boost in the amount of time and personal attention we give the client.Human contact and personal attention - I'm proud of how we handle it. Just like how I used to share my day-to-day worries with my girlfriends and family when I was younger, I still maintain that preference for speaking with another person. That human contact will continue playing a pronounced role in dealings between ABN AMRO and its clients. Simultaneously, interaction between man and machine is becoming more and more commonplace. At the bank we keep tabs on these developments so we can continue providing a healthy balance in the future. We're living in an era where people entrust chatbots with their secrets, and answer virtual psychologists' questions until they get to the bottom of things. And although my Tamagotchi simply ended up in a box after its demise, Japanese AIBO dogs are given a respectable funeral.Will we eventually see today's virtual assistant develop into your future virtual BFF? I’ll ask my Tamagotchi what it thinks. Or my girlfriends...

	In January 2018, Link announced a phased 20% per cent reduction in Interchange rates over four years, from around 25p to 20p. The first five percent cut took effect on 1 July 2018 and the second is scheduled to take place on 1 January 2019. The introduction of the first set of fees earlier this month led to calls from consumer groups for regulatory intervention to halt the closure of cash machines across the UK as banks and convenience stores re-assess the commercial viability of their networks under the new charging model.But it appears that a dip in ATM usage as consumers turn away from cash, rather than political uproar, has caused a rethink at Link.A decision to cancel the third reduction, due in January 2020 and put on hold the fourth cut, due in January 2021, has been prompted by figures showing a six percent year-on-year fall in the volume of ATM transactions.John Howells, chief executive of Link says: “Many consumers are turning to alternatives to cash more quickly than expected and usage of ATMs is now dropping at sic percent per annum. Link will therefore adjust interchange to maintain free-to-use coverage in line with our commitments to the public and to our participants.”

	The £2.5bn Patient Capital Fund has been launched to support UK companies with ""high growth potential"" and to enable them to access long-term investment. The government is also planning to open two international tech hubs in Brazil and South Africa.
In addition, the UK government has announced Startup Visa, a new visa path that proposes to streamline the application process for entrepreneurs and tech experts. It will replace the existing visa fastrack programme that was exclusively for graduates and will enable applicants to use endorsements from business sponsors or fintech accelerators as well as universities. 
The new visa plan, which is expected to launch in early 2019, was announced by home secretary Sajid Javid. ""The UK can be proud that we are a leading nation when it comes to tech and innovation but we want to do more to attract businesses to the UK and our migration system plays a key part in that,"" he said.
The initiative is also a concession to the numerous fintech figures that have called on the government to ease its hardline, post-Brexit stance on immigration, arguing that it could negatively affect the UK's ability to attract the best talent amid an ongoing battle among Europe's financial centres to become the international fintech hub of choice. 
In addition, the UK government's Tech Nation programme is launching its first talent contest, a programme designed to encourage UK fintechs to stay in the country by offering the chosen applicants free networking lunches, trips to meet potential partners in the US and tips from established fintech executives. 
The programme, which will begin in September, will be open to early-stage fintech firms that are based in the UK and can demonstrate some form of market success to a judging panel of fintech luminaries including Anne Boden, chief executive of Starling Bank. 
A lack of post-Brexit clarity has rattled the UK's fintech sector and also led other EU financial centres such as Paris, Dublin and Frankfurt to make explicit overtures to London-based startups to relocate. 
The City of London has consistently called on the UK government to do more to protect its fintech sector, calling for a digital skills visa in July 2017 and then calling for a single policy vision for fintechs in October 2017.
It remains to be seen whether the Tech Nation initiative will satisfy the City of London's demands but financial services minister John Glen was bullish in his promotion of the initiative. ""The programme will help to give some of these start-ups a boost to the next stage, and with it bring innovative new products to the market,” he said.

	With complementary strengths, fintech startups are increasingly looking to symbiotic collaboration with the traditional financial services firms they once sought to overthrow, according to the Capgemini study. The challenge is to scale-up and create financially-viable business models. Although fintech firms have raised nearly US$110 billion since 2009, the report found that most are likely to fail if they do not build an effective partnership ecosystem.At the same time, traditional financial institutions are adopting many agile fintech customer service enhancements, while retaining strengths including risk management, infrastructure, regulatory expertise, customer trust, access to capital, and more. “With more than 75% of fintech firms identifying their primary business objective as collaborating with traditional firms, it is essential that both fintechs and traditional firms transform their business models by collaborating to drive innovation while retaining customer trust,” says Anirban Bose, head of Capgemini’s financial services global strategic business Unit. “Without an agile and committed collaboration partner, both traditional and fintech firms risk failure.” Echoing the views of a similar report released by Accenture yesterday, Capgemini found that more than 70% of fintech executives polled said their top challenges to engaging with traditional financial firms was the latter's lack of agility, while incumbents in turn perceive negative impacts on customer trust, brand, and changing the internal culture as their top challenges. Both Accenture and Capgemini recommend the establishment of a formal process for banks to chart their relationships with startups.

By adopting a 'Thin Wedge' approach to innovation, says Guy Halford-Thompson, co-founder and director of enterprise blockchain company BTL Group 
	Gone are the days of companies deciding what their IT strategy will be for the next 10 years, and going to huge systems integrators, with multi billion dollar contracts to roll out static IT systems. Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, and in order to remain relevant, companies are having to look at new approaches to innovation. The most important factor by far, is the ability to innovate quickly.It should be no surprise to the industry that smaller companies are able to innovate faster. A smaller company, with less people, a more agile structure, and less legacy structure, is always going to be able to innovate faster than a large company with thousands of employees, decades of legacy systems, and a very rigid structure. In order to remain relevant, large companies are increasingly working with startups, many of which have existed for less than a fiscal cycle, and with a fraction of a percent of the workforce of the larger company.The disparity between startups and large companies creates friction from a number of areas. Startups are notoriously bad for understanding their own capacity, or the implications of business and technical requirements from their large clients. Startups who land a big client are blinded by the opportunity and will typically take on as much scope as possible to inflate the size of the project. Furthermore this leads to the dangerous impression that their startup is being successful - they can correctly claim that their clients keep increasing the size of the project, and therefore the potential rewards are higher, but they will quickly find themselves drowning in that success. After founder disagreements, over commitment to projects is the biggest reason that startups fail. Because of over-commitment, startups will often find themselves having to dedicate a large proportion of their team to the project, and if not careful, can find itself in a position where the success or failure of the company is intrinsically linked to the success of the project. What is an industry defining project for a startup, is likely a small side project for the larger client.The sheer number of pilots we are seeing at the moment (in particular in the blockchain space) would suggest that there is a lot of success happening. However, the sad truth is that the vast majority of projects will never make it past the pilot stage, and were doomed to fail before they even started.A pilot is a small scale preliminary study conducted in order to evaluate feasibility, time, cost, and various other criteria of a project before committing to a full scale project or change in strategy. What most companies (both large and small) fail to understand is that by far the most challenging part of a project is - to borrow a phrase from Geoffrey Moore - crossing the chasm from pilot to production. For a project to have even a remote chance of success, a significant amount of the work in the pilot has to be dedicated to how it will cross the chasm.The WhatThe Thin Wedge Approach is an innovation methodology developed at BTL to enable us to work with clients who are many thousands of times larger than us, ensuring we are able to deliver projects that can cross the chasm from pilot to production, while not letting individual projects balloon out of control. The key principle of the Thin Wedge Approach is as follows:The goal of the Thin Wedge Approach is to deliver the smallest possible product fully into production, while demonstrating how value can quickly be increased in neighbouring areas of the business.The Thin Wedge Approach achieves 2 key goals. It ensures that project scope is always manageable by the startup (allowing it to cross the chasm to production), and it reduces the risk to the startup if the project does not succeed. The latter is because, by keeping the scope limited until the product is fully launched in production, the startup does not have to invest significant resources until they know the product has succeeded, rather than tying up the majority of their workforce trying to deal with pilot scope - and drowning in their success.By applying this approach, startups are able to reduce much of the friction that is created when very large companies work with small startups, while at the same time allowing both parties to achieve their individual goals, at a much lower risk and cost.The HowCompanies do not set out with a goal to expand the scope of projects beyond what is manageable, but without specific controls in place, this often becomes the case. Most importantly, the Thin Wedge Approach needs to be applied from day one, and all participants in the project need buy into it. Critically, all parties at the table need to understand the key principles of the approach:•	A significant amount of the pilot project needs to be dedicated to crossing the chasm to production•	Smaller scope is prioritized over larger cost savings (or revenue generation)•	The pilot needs to demonstrate how, once launched, the scope can be expanded to handle additional requirements or other areas of the businessSome of these principles, in particular when it comes to prioritizing scope reduction over cost savings need to be approached carefully with the client. Importantly, a smaller scope means the project will be deployed in production faster, and therefore the cost savings, while smaller will be realized much sooner. Additionally, every incremental improvement on the project will have an immediate impact on the bottom line, rather than delaying the start of the entire project.Final NoteThe reason pilot projects exist is to provide an environment where we can fail fast, and the Thin Wedge Approach should not be confused with an attempt to salvage pilots which don't meet the technical or business goals that have been set out for them.Many of the pilots we read about today, however, are fundamentally flawed in their approach and, even if they do achieve the technical or business goals, will never succeed in crossing the chasm from pilot to production, and are at risk of dragging the associated startup down with them.The Thin Wedge Approach lays out a framework for running a pilot, with a clear goal of turning a successful pilot into a production product.

	Data sourced from Pitch Book by the Mayor's promotional team at London & Partners shows that global investors continue to pump large sums of money into London fintech companies, with the research revealing that 2017 is set to be a record year for investment into both London and the UK’s fintech sectors. Over $1 billion (£825m) has been poured into the UK’s financial technology companies since the beginning of the year, double the amount raised compared with the same period in 2016. The research also suggests that British companies are on course to raise more money in 2017 than the records set in 2015, with the data showing firms have already received more investment than the first three quarters of 2015. The findings have been released to coincide with an upcoming trade mission of London financial technology companies to Money 20/20. Companies joining the delegation include foreign exchange banking app, Revolut, which recently raised $66m in Series B funding and AI based ID verification app Onfido which received $30m in funding in September this year.

	New figures from the founders of London Tech Week say the capital's burgeoning fintech scene scored over £177 million of funding since the beginning of the year - more than any other quarter in 2016. The numbers were driven by major deals for Funding Circle (£82 million), Monzo (£22 million) and Currency Cloud (£20.27 million). Another report from tech investment bank GP Bullhound, positions London as the European capital for fintech unicorns, pointing out that the UK houses four tech behemoths with a combined value of $18.5bn, compared to just two in the rest of Europe, which are worth $4.6bn between them. Nik Storonsky, founder & CEO of Revolut, says: ""Fintech produces more billion-dollar-valued startups than any other segment in the UK, and includes digital financial services, from money transfer to peer-to-peer loans. There is no doubt in our minds that London will remain a hub for fintech irrespective of what a few fear mongering individuals might say.""Storonsky's views can be seen as a rebuff to fellow fintech founder Taavet Hinrikus of Transferwise who remains outspokenly pessimistic about Britain's future outside of Europe. At a government-backed conference last week designed to trumpet the UK as a post-Brexit fintech powerhouse, the CEO of Transferwise went off-message, suggesting startups should avoid London and confirming that his own firm will move its European headquarters to the mainland. Likewise, Azimo has moved to open an office in Dublin, fearful that the loss of passporting rights and a clampdown on free movement of people will hurt the business and do irreparable damage to London's status as a fintech powerhouse.Storonsky takes a strikingly different position: ""Revolut is passionate about nurturing the home-grown talent that continues to drive UK fintech forward, as well as continuing to attract the best people from around the world and Brexit won't change this.

	The comments were delivered at the International Fintech Conference held in London - an event put on by the UK Treasury to encourage greater investment in the sector from home and abroad.
""We will have to strive and graft and fight to seize the opportunities - and make the most of them. That means growing and strengthening the areas – like fintech – in which we enjoy a competitive advantage,"" said Hammond. 
London was recently ranked alongside Singapore as the top destination for fintech in a report by Deloitte but Hammond warned against complacency.
""We can’t remain the number one place for fintech and the other technologies of the fourth industrial revolution by simply relying on our ingenuity, talent and openness, we have to go out and get the business.""
The UK is also planning to focus its fintech efforts on other major cities besides London. At another event this week, the Innovate Finance Global Summit 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority's director of strategy and competition Christopher Woolard cited the Edinburgh-Glasgow corridor and the Leeds/Manchester conurbation as places ""where 'Fin' and 'Tech' collide"".
But immigration will be central to the UK's efforts to retain the talent necessary to maintain its status as the international fintech hub of choice, a point that was not lost on the Chancellor. ""We need to continue to attract the brightest and the best from around the world to these shores.""
Hammond is generally seen as a proponent of higher immigration rates than his cabinet colleagues. Given the focus on the issue in the wake of Brexit, immigration controls could be as influential as the technology in deciding the UK's fintech ambitions. 
Back in November 2015, way before the shock Brexit referendum result, a consortium of start-up founders, including the heads of TransferWise and Nutmeg, warned then Prime Minister David Cameron that a clampdown on immigration could hamper the UK's digital economy and fintech industry. 
At the same conference today, Bank of England governor Mark Carney also went out of his way to talk up the promise of fintech and its potential to unbundle banking into its core functions.
""FinTech could deliver significant benefits to households and businesses across this country and across the world. FinTech can widen access to financial services and bring new sources of credit. It can connect customers better with their finances and empower them more in the process.

	An open letter to UK prime minister David Cameron was signed by the founders of more than 230 tech start-ups and investors, including a number of successful fintech outfits such as Nutmeg, TransferWise and Yo-Yo Wallet.
As part of an effort to reduce net migration levels, the UK government is considering raising the minimum salary level requirement for its entrepreneur visa and Tier 2 system of skilled work visas, both of which are used by many tech start-ups to bring in IT talent from abroad.
""The UK has become a global tech hub thanks in large to start-up founders and employees from across the globe, including many of us who were not born in Britain but choose to invest our time and talents here,"" states the letter. ""We call on you to ensure that any future changes to the immigration system make it easier, not harder, for qualified digital entrepreneurs to come to the UK to start their business and for growing start-ups to hire top international talent.""

	Hong Kong Exchange & Clearing (HKEx) was formed in 1986 to consolidate the trading of four local bourses onto one trading floor. However, the decision in 1996 to allow brokers to host a trading terminal on their own premises paved the way for a gradual migration from the exchange's trading floor. 
In 2000 the exchange launched a new order matching system to allow online trading and also removed the cap on how much trading could take place off-exchange. Six years later the trading hall was renovated and went from more than 900 trading booth to less than 300. 
Trading volumes on the floor also dwindled. In 2014, the last time the exchange bothered to publish figures for on-floor trading, it accounted for just 0.2% of total turnover. 
Consequently the decision to close the trading floor was inevitable and follows the example of countless other exchanges internationally, including the London Stock Exchange and in Asia Pacific, including Tokyo and Singapore. 
The New York Stock Exchange still retains its trading floor, even if the daily bell-rining to signal the start of trading is more for the benefit of television and marketing than the member brokers and dealers. 
However, human trading may not be entirely dead quite yet. The BOX Options Exchange, owned by Canadian group TMX, has stated its belief that face-face floor-based trading can help derivatives traders get a better view of liquidity and prices and has recently won approval to open a trading floor in Chicago.
But as the HKEx closes the doors on its trading hall for the last time, the rumours suggest that it is going to fully embrace the rise in algorithmic and high frequency traders (HFTs).
According to a report by Bloomberg, the HKEx is planning to petition the city to remove stamp duty on exchange transactions, thus making it more attractive to the HFTs trading in high volume. 
And in January, the exchange announced plans for an overhaul of its systems that could include greater use of blockchain and cloud technology in its post-trade services.

	The Utility Settlement Coin (USC) was first thought up in 2015 when the Swiss bank UBS teamed up with UK-based blockchain company Clearmatics to launch the concept of a fully asset-backed digital cash instrument that would be cleared and settled via distributed ledger technology such as blockchain.
A year later the pair were joined by BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and broker/dealer Icap. And now six more major banks have been recruited.
The six comprise Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street and have joined at a time when the project shitfts into the next stage of development, according to Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investment and fintech innovation at UBS.
“We have been in discussions with central banks and regulators and we will continue that over the next 12 months with the aim of a limited ‘go live’ at the back end of 2018,” he told the Financial Times.
The discussions will centre on improving data privacy and cyber security in order to appease regulatory concerns. Jaffrey said that the USC will most likely be used in the interbank market to start with, enabling banks to repay each other in different currencies without having to go through the current  cross-border settlement infrastructure and instead rely on the potentially more efficient DLT. 
The next step will be to enable banks to settle securities transactions via the USC, however this will necessitate all the relevant securities to be transferred to blockchain systems to gain the settlement and verification benefits of the technology.
The tamper-proof algorithms employed by DLT allows users to automate the settlement process without the need for third-party verification and, following some initial scepticism, has now been embraced by a growing number of market participants eager to find the best way to realise the risk, capital and efficiency benefits of the technology.
“The distributed ledger is one of the most innovative technologies out there,” said Lee Braine from the chief technology office of Barclays’ investment bank. “From reducing risk to improving capital efficiency in financial markets we see several benefits of this project.”

	The survey of 80 capital markets executives by The Tabb Group on behalf of City consultancy Synechron, paints a confusing picture for a post-Brexit Britain. One of the major findings of the research conducted in September was that 72% of British bankers said they believed London would still be the financial centre of Europe in five years’ time.Yet despite this, 55% have set up Brexit Steering Committees to prepare for life outside the EU. A popular topic for these committees is likely to be relocation from the UK to another European financial centre, which Synechron has calculated to cost an average of £50,000 per employee. Synechron’s research also found 56% of senior British capital markets executives believe that compliance costs will increase following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU), with not one executive expecting regulatory costs to decrease. This contrasts a popular view that Brexit would reduce red-tape for financial institutions.Tim Cuddeford, managing director at Synechron Business Consulting says: “Banks are no longer waiting for the Government to trigger Article 50 and have begun setting up Steering Committees to plan for life outside the European Union, with some already considering relocating staff to other cities around Europe. Whilst Brexit poses an unforeseen challenge for financial institutions, the prospect of rising compliance and huge relocation costs appear inevitable.”While the new relationship with the EU remains to be shaped, the survey indicates mixed views on how to proceed. 19% of respondents believe that the UK should pursue the ‘Norway option’ and negotiate to remain part of the European Economic Area, whilst 18% believe the UK should follow the ‘Swiss model’ and negotiate bilateral treaties.

	Put together by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB), the report identifies 10 fintech-related areas that ""merit authorities' attention"".Three of these are priorities for international collaboration: managing operational risk from third-party service providers; mitigating cyber risks; and monitoring macrofinancial risks that could emerge as fintech activities increase.The report identifies several benefits associated with fintech, including decentralisation and increased intermediation by non-financial entities; greater efficiency, transparency, competition and resilience of the financial system; and greater financial inclusion and economic growth. But with these come potential risks, such as institution-specific micro-financial risks that could emerge and system-wide macro-financial risks, for instance increased connectedness and correlation risk.The FSB argues that the private sector needs to improve data on fintech applications, and regulators must understand how businesses and the market structure are changing. In particular, international bodies and national authorities should take fintech into account in their risk assessments and regulatory frameworks.Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor, Bank of Canada and chair of the FSB’s Fintech Issues Group, says: ""Regulators need to understand the impact that developments in fintech can have on financial stability, especially given the rapid rise of innovation in this space.""

	The research, based on 22,000 online interviews with digitally active consumers across 20 markets, shows that the emerging markets are driving much of this adoption with China, India, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico averaging a 46% participation rate. The UK has also shown significant growth, as the arrival of a new generation of challenger banks rise up to take on the incumbents, with adoption rates now standing at 42%. Across all markets, cheaper money transfers and more streamlined mobile payments services are leading the fintech charge with adoption standing at 50% in 2017. Imran Gulamhuseinwala, EY global fintech leader, says: “Fintechs are clearly gaining widespread traction across global markets and have achieved the early stages of mass adoption in most countries. On average, one in three consumers already consume fintech services on a regular basis.” The demographic most likely to use fintech services are millennials - 25-34-year olds, followed by 35- 44-year olds. The study finds that people in this age range are comfortable with the technology and that they also require a wide range of financial services as they achieve milestones such as completing their education, gaining full-time employment, becoming homeowners and having children.The study has also identified a new segment of users, the ‘super-user’. These individuals use five or more fintech services and account for 13% of all consumers. ‘Super-users’ generally consider fintech firms to be their primary providers of financial services, says Gulamhuseinwala. “Fintechs are not only becoming significant players in the financial services industry, but are also shaping its future,"" he says. ""Their new propositions are increasingly attractive to consumers and this trend is only set to continue as awareness grows, concerns are allayed and new advancements are made. Traditional firms, who sometimes struggle to deliver the same seamless and personalised user experiences, will undoubtedly need to step up their efforts to remain competitive.”Based on consumers’ intention of future use, fintech adoption could increase to an average of 52% globally, says Gulamhuseinwala.

	Over the last few years, the fintech hype machine has been in overdrive, with a digital revolution promising to change market structure, radically improve products and services, and save the high street veterans from sliding into invisible utilities.The Accenture report says that these promises have yet to come to pass; old fashioned banks are still standing, and perhaps standing still, while startups have yet to gain real traction in customer acquisition and seen their VC investment decline by more than a third in the last year. Nevertheless, Accenture suggests that the revolution is more likely to be stalled than dead. The firm argues that the UK can establish itself as a leading exporter of fintech R&D, helping individual firms monetise their expertise and 'UK plc' build the county's digital reputation.To do this, the report argues that government and regulators must compete with rivals such as Singapore to attract investment and talent. This is particularly important at the moment because of Brexit, which may result in limiting of free movement and see banks shift operations overseas.Concludes the report: ""The reality of the Fintech scene today is that its full impact can’t yet be predicted. As Zhou Enlai said in the 1970s when asked if the French Revolution had been a success - 'it’s still too early to tell'.

	In recent years, new fintech entrants have brought innovation to the financial sector like never before. And while some transaction banks may have initially viewed them as a threat to their market dominance, they are increasingly looking to learn from fintechs’ fresh approach to industry challenges. As such, many see collaboration as the way forward, with transaction banks and fintechs leveraging their respective strengths - and minimising their weaknesses.Indeed, the risk of fintechs driving transaction banking disintermediation is largely overstated - in part because of their differing strengths and objectives. Fintechs generally aim to corner a specific service or product within the wider value chain, while many transaction banks have the scale and historical depth to offer a wide range of critical services across the entire chain.What’s more, since transaction banks’ solutions are positioned in terms of wider customer relationships - many based on mutual trust forged over many years - it is unlikely that fintechs will challenge bank dominance any time soon. Nevertheless, they bring innovative approaches and fresh ideas to some of the most challenging problems in the industry. And if these can be combined with transaction banks’ industry knowledge and deep customer relationships, the benefits to both parties - and, by extension, their corporate clients - will be considerable.A model for successSuch collaboration can be achieved through a number of different models or frameworks. Partnership models, for instance, have seen a great deal of success and are increasingly popular. These usually involve the bank integrating a fintech solution into their current offering, or supporting a fintech’s development by leveraging its historical industry expertise. Some partnerships involve the joint delivery of solutions to customers, while others might see a bank provide the financing capability to underpin a fintech solution. For instance, UniCredit recently partnered with a fintech, integrating into their supply chain finance (SCF) platform to support one of the bank’s core relationship clients. The client benefitted from new levels of flexibility when financing suppliers, while UniCredit was able to offer support even when direct bank financing wasn’t required - strengthening the bank-client relationship. And, aside from the type of partnership, there are also choices to be made in terms of branding: a bank-fintech partnership could launch a product mutually under both brands, or the bank could offer the fintech solution as a white-label product, paying a licence fee to do so. Transaction banks may also finance or acquire promising fintechs, and venture capital funds and growth accelerators are also used by banks to help develop fintech start-ups. UniCredit sees potential in this approach and has established UniCredit evo - a USD 200 million fund that focuses exclusively on identifying and investing in fintech companies. The bank also has a fintech accelerator in Italy that is currently supporting four of the most promising start-ups in the industry.Only the best will doWhatever the form a bank-fintech relationship takes, the customer must be placed at the heart of the value proposition - with a focus on matching or exceeding customer expectations of quality, security and integrity. Indeed, just like any start-up, a significant proportion of fintech solutions are destined to fail, while critical business functions such as the treasury can prove too complex for fintech solutions to tackle adequately. Banks must therefore carefully screen potential fintech partners to be assured of the quality of solutions as well as the long-term, sustainable viability of the overall offering. Above all, identifying the specific customer use cases most applicable to the technology is critical.Without question, fintech entrants have triggered radical change in the financial services industry. At UniCredit, technological innovation has always been central to our approach, and we are excited to explore the potential of fintech to accelerate developments in the transaction banking industry and improve our customer offering. To have various parties collaborate, playing to their strengths to offer innovative new solutions is a win for all involved - not least the corporate customer.

	The foundation, which rates banking products on how well they promote financial well-being, says that the sector is showing signs of putting their customers' needs at the heart of their operations for the time since the 2008 crisis.After previous reports by the Foundation identified ""alarmingly"" low levels of customer focus, over the last three years, it has recorded an increase of 57% in its ratings of current and savings accounts.Almost all current accounts analysed now alert customers when the balance is near the overdraft limit and nearly half of savings accounts let users set their individual savings goals and tag expenditure based on categories.And of eight product categories analysed, fintech challengers come top in three: U Account by Ffrees is crowned top current account with no overdraft, Squirrel wins top regular savings account, and Osper tops children's savings account.Elsewhere, Clydesdale Bank wins best current account with an overdraft, Capital One best credit card, Santander best personal loans, Barclays best student current account, and Coventry Building Society best mortgages.Antony Elliott, chief executive, Fairbanking Foundation, says: ""In 2008, banking could have been compared to a cocktail bar, pushing drinks at customers who’d already had enough.

	In the ever-expanding fintech ecosystem, it is easy to get caught up in all the hoopla, hysteria and hype. As we enter 2017, PwC’s DeNovo is providing our views on more plausible changes of direction in the fintech space.
1. One-size-fits-all robo-advisors will struggle
Fintech efforts to redefine wealth management in the US have resulted in an all-too-crowded field of one-size-fits-all robo-advisors. Nine of the top ten asset managers in the US have now developed (or are considering developing) in-house robo models or partnering with third-party providers. Herd mentality, or more accurately stated, herd algorithms, could diminish the lure of stand-alone robo-advisors and will likely relegate them to just another distribution channel, more akin to the evolution and integration of online brokerage into traditional wealth managers.
 
2. Blockchain security may prove to be short lived
Fundamentally, blockchain is software code and is the same form of language instruction upon which an operating system, a database, and the internet are constructed, all of which are vulnerable. Security around various blockchain applications and protocols will likely be subject to attempted security breaches. While troubling, this will enable financial services firms to decide appropriate business use cases, incident responses, and redundancy plans for blockchain application deployment.
3. It’s the end of the rewards (world) as we know it
The need for an overhaul of the rewards concept will begin to materialize, as programs that deliver points or cash (read: delayed gratification) will find it increasingly difficult to reinforce customer loyalty or influence spending habits in the transition to a mobile-first society where customers expect immediate gratification and contextual rewards.
 
4. Traditional insurance will retain the upper hand over InsurTech
Traditional insurance products will retain 100% market share despite the hype in InsurTech. Even considering the positive outlier trends in InsurTech investment, the more promising disruptors are years away from gaining any measurable share. The byzantine regulatory landscape in insurance is far more complex relative to that of banking. For example, insurance companies are subject to regulation in all 50 states with a myriad of rate and form filing requirements. Furthermore, in an industry where underwriting and capital management are two of the key factors of success, in almost all lines insurers are best at managing risk, and capital intensive balance sheet requirements are not well suited to be disrupted by new entrants.
5. A reverse merger will play a part in the consolidation
Fintech startups will look to acquire incumbent banks as a faster means to take deposits, facilitate balance sheet lending, or bypass the still uncertain regulatory environment. Most expect 2017 to mark the start of fintech market consolidation with leaders emerging, fast followers struggling, and consolidation defined by “tuck-in” activity. But a fintech startup acquiring a bank may provide a more efficient method to safely differentiate from the pack.
While the race often favors the swift and the battle the strong, if 2016 has taught us anything, that may not always be the best way to bet. That’s especially true in a fast-moving and ever-changing ecosystem like fintech. PwC’s DeNovo aims to avoid group think, and you might be better served too as well.

Of the top 20 global deals, only one company was from the UK - Starling Bank - which secured $101 million in funding.Over 60% of the UK VC investment in fintech in 2016 was in challenger banks, SME financing and money transfer, FX, distributed ledger and digital currency verticals. Eight of the top 20 UK deals closed post Brexit totalling $105m. 64% of the UK deals in Q3 were follow-on investment rounds and 67% of UK investments for this period were by UK domiciled funds.More worryingly, Innovate Finance claims 30 fintech start-ups have had their funding cancelled or postponed by investors since the end of June, forcing them to seek urgent funding elsewhere.A quarterly survey of fintech investment trends by KPMG and CBInsights backed up the gloomy assessment. Their just-released Q3 report shows that the UK saw decreases in both the number of deals and total investment in the quarter, while the German fintech sector is now on track to outperform the UK this year Commenting on the findings, Lawrence Wintermeyer, CEO of Innovate Finance says: “While the UK still attracted a high number of deals for fintech there’s been a significant drop in investment year on year to Q3 2016.

	Set up by the G20 in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been working over the last few years to coordinate efforts to ensure a repeat of the disaster does not occur.While the emerging fintech scene is something that the board has been keeping tabs on, secretary general Svein Andresen says: ""We have seen many interesting trends over last few years in fintech.

Meanwhile, the group is also undertaking a study of the key elements underlying fintech innovations, identifying three promises associated with the sector: greater access to and convenience of financial services; greater efficiency of financial services; and a push toward a more decentralised financial system.""These elements have financial stability implications, especially if the trend toward adoption of fintech continues. As a result, authorities should be vigilant and should actively monitor the effects that fintech innovations have on specific products and services, as well as on incumbent financial institutions, financial markets, and the economy more broadly,"" says Andresen.

	Great entrepreneurs feed off of disruption - whether geopolitical or technological.As a venture capital investor, I back entrepreneurs who take advantage of change to create transformational businesses. So I was struck by how vocal London’s tech investors and entrepreneurs were in backing the Remain camp in the referendum. I was also surprised by their reaction to the outcome - one of disbelief and fear. It seemed remarkably risk averse for a group of people that are praised and rewarded for their dynamism. After all it’s the same people that preach about the unstoppable force of change and that profit from disruption. Why aren’t they embracing change and seeing the incredible opportunity that it presents?Let’s examine their concerns. First is the belief that a Brexit hinders investment and hold companies back. Now it’s possible that an investor is worried about the uncertainty but to think that a risk investor will decline the opportunity to have a stake in a great business in a turbulent environment is absurd. Berlin or Tel Aviv may come into focus but come with their own issues. They may of course be less inclined to gamble on a mediocre business whose path to profitability depends entirely on EU membership but these are surely the exception. I also struggle to comprehend why a bank with fewer employees in London would be less likely to invest in or acquire a meaningful London fintech business - another theory I’ve seen touted - or why a listing on the London Stock exchange is less likely this week than last. Great businesses will always get the funding they need; Skype, Google and others were created in the midst of the dotcom crash. Indeed from my company’s perspective (our office is in Luxembourg), UK businesses just got 15 per cent cheaper.Regulatory and legal hurdles are cited as another major concern - the theory being that our access to European markets will diminish and startups will be faced with an additional or more fragmented regulatory framework to overcome. But regulation is just one of a myriad of problems that a founder will have to solve in order to be successful. If you are truly worried about regulation then you probably wouldn’t have set up a business in the first place. Founders focus on developing great products that customers will enjoy and assume that regulatory hurdles can be overcome. History has shown that they can be, even when you’re taking on the telecoms industry.In fact, the FCA and PRA have already reacted. Last year, they created the Bank Startup Unit - a differential system that already distorts the single market concept by implementing a UK specific regulatory environment giving local companies a head start. The Regulatory Sandbox and Project Innovate can now thrive without reference to European rules. The rhetoric of the fintech lobbyists in London is particularly parochial so it seems odd that they’re not celebrating the opportunity to further distance themselves from the regulatory regime of Europe. Without constraints from EU legislation, presumably the UK can make it’s own economic policy, incentives and even state aid where needed and build regulatory bridges to the largest financial market in the world - the United States.Entrepreneurs have also argued that Brexit could impact their ability to hire talent. Yet greater control over migration may help the Government pick and choose who is able to enter the country. A new immigration policy could favour employment from the Far East and the United States - allowing specialists from these markets to help fill skills gaps in the UK. Once again, an initiative already created under the Exceptional Talent Visa scheme can now easily be extended without regard to the EU. I have every faith that the UK can adapt to this historic change. It is after all one of the strongest economies in Europe. Let’s not forget that English is a global language and London is a cultural powerhouse. It is a world leader in finance and remains in a prime geographical position - midway between Singapore and New York. It is also the largest capital city in Europe, providing opportunities not just for entrepreneurs and their employees, but also their families and children. It now has the ability to create its own policies, align its own passporting rules with the largest financial economies, avoid financial transaction taxes, access worldwide labour markets and import from anywhere.An attractive and differentiated UK environment may just be the medicine the doctor ordered for fintech startups. Meanwhile incumbents now face the considerable task, and enormous distraction, of unpicking the implications of a Brexit and planning their businesses accordingly. Indeed, from where I’m standing it looks like this new paradigm could be the best thing ever to happen for UK fintech.

	A survey conducted by Innovate Finance of 100 member firms tapped into a deep well of dread about London's prospects as a European fintech hub in the wake of the referendum result.""If the UK loses passporting and the seemless access to the European financial market that it has thus far enjoyed, both the finance and technology sectors will FLOOD out of London,"" says one survey participant. ""The cost of living here is already way too high...as a cash strapped startup, trying to hire talent on bare-bones salaries, any excuse to leave to Berlin, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam, or Lisbon is one that we'd jump at.""Its worth noting here that the leading candidate to take over the leadership of the UK Conservative party, Theresa May, is refusing to offer any guarantees on the future rights of EU workers to remain in the country, further compounding the uncertainties.Professor Peter Hahn of the London Institute of Banking and Finance, says the new world order is presenting Britain's financial services sector with a wholly unfamiliar set of new risk issues to ponder. ""The uncertainty of foreigners’ residency implies that every bank & finance business in the UK needs to quickly survey its employee register and understand the nationalities of its employees,"" he says. ""Are some key people in the IT department German, Estonian, or Spanish? What about management? They may have been happy employees and they may be thinking about leaving. How replaceable are they?"" The UK's burgeoning fintech community currently employs 66,000 people, of which 30% are estimated to hail from the EU and overseas. The report cites money transfer firm Azimo, where three quarters of the workforce are non-Britons, as a typical example.""Fintech human capital has complex skill sets, such as advanced computer science, regulatory understanding and knowledge of capital markets processes, and it is dependent on domain knowledge,"" states the report. ""If UK financial services loses freedom of movement, we must ensure we can access the talent we need. Creating a more liberal regime for skilled workers (esp in tech) would be a potential angle here.""Other worries centre around a softening of VC inflows to the sector as uncertainty about the future drags on, a point which has been rammed home by the Bank of England in its recent financial stability report, which warns of a further deterioration of investor appetite for UK assets. The potential for regulatory fragmentation is also an issue, with firms concerned about access to EU-wide data sharing agreements emanating from a new crop of payments directives, and the application of anti-money laundering legislation and data protection rules.Independent observers are no less gloomy. Dun & Bradstreest has moved to downgrade the UK’s risk rating from DB2a (on a par with the US) to DB2c, and anticipates that there may be further downward revisions in the coming weeks and months.“Over the medium term, the most important question will be the nature of relations between the UK and the EU. Political developments, such as the outcome of the Conservative Party leadership contest and when Article 50 is invoked, will severely impact the economy,"" says the ratings agency. ""Against this backdrop of elevated uncertainty, investment activity will remain subdued and the UK faces a period of lower growth. In the worst case scenario that the UK loses access to the common market, there would be very negative repercussions for the wider economy, with the financial sector being hit particularly hard.”

	Blockchain tech was used to sell an oil cargo shipment containing African crude three times on its way to China, with traders, banks as well as an agent and an inspector, all performing their role in the transaction directly on the 'Easy Trading Connect' platform.Easy Trading Connect was last year’s winner of ING's Innovation Bootcamp, in which employees are challenged to come up with smart ideas for transforming banking. Teams with the best ideas are given the chance to turn their idea into reality with help of ING’s Innovation Studio. With commodity trading and finance still heavily reliant on physical paper documents making their way across the globe, the partners say that the industry is ripe for an overhaul. The experiment found that by making efficiency gains in certain processes, the average total time for a bank to complete its role in the transaction could be slashed from approximately three hours to 25 minutes.In addition, applying distributed ledger technology to the commodity trade financing chain can prevent issues such as documentary fraud and allows for the digitalisation of assets, claim the pilot participants. Patrick Arnaud, MD, trade and commodity finance, ING, says: “The commodity finance industry is hampered by nature by inefficiencies and outdated procedures. By applying blockchain technology, we expect that we can eliminate a lot of these, making the overall process faster and more cost effective and the tests we have been able to carry out have proved this.""Federico Turegano, global head, natural resources and infrastructure, Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking adds: ""The Easy Trading Connect platform allowed real-time access to information for all parties, eliminating the need for an acknowledgment process. It also keeps a full data record, which is useful for auditing and as well as having an intuitive navigation system and a well thought through design.""

	A report from US-based, not-for-profit research firm Pitchbook has based its figures on 42 investments made in UK tech startups over the last month. The biggest of these deals involved a $65m investment in cyber security firm Darktrace. .
 
The figure is lower than the $338m raised by startups in the same period last year, however the survey only includes VC capital rather than any M&A actvity, therefore excluding the $32bn paid by Japan's SoftBank for UK chip maker ARM.
 
The report has led London mayor Sadiq Khan to talk up London's credentials as a fintech hub. ""This investment in the capital shows that London is open for business, open for new ideas and will continue to welcome the best talent from around the world.""
 
The UK's National Technology Adviser, Liam Maxwell, has also been promoting the UK's status as a centre for fintech investment and, talking to Finance Magnates magazine, has refuted the fear that other European cities such as Berlin may be better positioned to attract tech startups in a post-Brexit Europe.
 
""Berlin is a great place. Honestly. If they want to go, they can go. I just doubt that they will find all that they are looking for. London has the best conditions for a tech company. The network is still in London. The best people are still in London.""
 
The bullishness of Khan and Maxwell is not evidently shared by fintech leaders and investors though. A recent survey into post-Brexit sentiment from UK government-backed Tech City UK reported that the majority of startup leaders and investors belived there is ""cause for optimism"" in the face of the Brexit decision. However, nearly a quarter of the 1,200 respondents also said they expect to scale back their expansion plans as a result of the Brexit vote.
 
The UK's fund management sector has fared less well than its fintech counterpart. Five of the largest fund managers operating in the UK - Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, Schroders, M&G and Invesco - have suffered serious outflows with investors withdrawing more than €1bn from each of the managers' funds.
 
The data, collected by research firm Morningstar, is the first such report on fund flows to be published since the Brexit vote and confirms the fears expressed by the UK's fund management market of the implications of EU withdrawal.
 
According to Morningstar director Ali Masarwah, who was speaking to the Financial Times, the outflows were ""basically the stampede of nervous investors exting these equity funds"".

Sterling initially hit $1.50 as early exit polls indicated a narrow victory for the Remain vote, but as the results trickled in the pound began its precipitous tumble.In the days leading up to the historic vote, City bosses had issued dire warnings of the consequences for the UK's financial markets and London's burgeoning fintech industry in the event of an exit. JPMorgan has already issued a memo to staff saying that some jobs will have to be relocated over the coming months, while Britain's banks have taken a huge hit on the stock market, losing up to 30% of their value as the FTSE slipped by 11.3% in early morning trading.Simon Black, CEO of the PPRO Group believes the narrow 52%/48% victory for the Brexiteers could cost the UK tax authorities £5 billion in lost revenue over the next ten years as the country's estimated 500 fintech companies assess their options.

	The Swiss Federal Council has recommended a three-pronged strategy to support fintech startups. Firstly, it suggests holding money in settlement accounts to help crowdfunding services. Secondly, it advises launching a regulatory sandbox for fintech startups so that they will not be subject to monitoring from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) aside from AML oversight.
Thirdly, the Council is pushing for a new fintech license to be granted by FINMA, restricted to deposit-taking businesses and not lending institutions. The license would warrant a less stringent regulatory landscape, such as lower capital requirements.
In addition, the Council would also like to see a reduction in the barriers to entry for fintech startups outside of the traditional financial services regulations, designed to appeal to crypto-currency providers.
According to Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer, these steps will hopefully encourage more innovative fintech startups to set up in Switzerland. ""We assume that with ther steps we have prepared and the commitment we have to the overall financial services industry we can provide a solution that puts us among the top (countries) in the world that regulate this,"" he said to Reuters. 
The Council would like to see a consultation draft drawn up by the Swiss Federal Department of Finance in early 2017.
The announcement of the fintech initiative comes shortly after a redefining of corporate governance rules for Swiss banks, including the streamlining of the regulatory framework, as Switzerland continues to try and woo fintech firms amid the uncertainty over Brexit and its implications for UK-based startups especially.   
It also follows a raft of initiatives launched by FINMA back in March to stimulate futher growth in the country's emerging fintech sector, which included new rules for onboarding clients using online identification.

	The fintech community has, like most other business sectors, come out broadly against brexit. A recent Financial News poll of financial technology firms found that more than two-thirds believe leaving the EU would be detrimental to the UK startup scene.
Last week US payment systems giant ACI Worldwide entered the debate, warning that a Brexit would be ""disastrous"" for the UK fintech community and seriously jeopardise London's role as a central hub for financial services in Europe.
Now, in a report commissioned by Fintech Week, William Garrity Associates has tried to calculate the cost of a leave vote, estimating that billions of pounds are at stake because of 10 factors which make Brexit bad for UK fintech. 
Among them are the human capital costs which will arise from the end of free movement of EU nationals; reduced access to EU markets, the loss of the UK's leadership in 'regtech'; and a lack of say in the formulation of the single European capital market and digital single market initiatives.
Ian Dowson, CEO, William Garrity Associates, says: ""When I started to analyse the implications of Brexit on UK companies in the fintech space I tried exceptionally hard to find positives on each of the 10 criteria. I failed. Brexit will be catastrophic for UK fintech companies. 
""The alternatives of integrating closer with the USA or negotiating a new deal with the EU will take an extraordinary amount of time and effort, at least five years’ worth and in the life of a start-up or innovator, this is a lifetime. Any sensible company looking to scale will have no choice but to relocate to the EU; I would if I was in their position."" 
Among the names coming out in favour of Remain, is Sean Park, founder of venture investment and advisory firm Anthemis, who warns: ""The negative impact on the two most crucial success factors for the fintech start-ups, namely access to markets in other EU countries and access to talent from these countries would be huge if Britain choses to call time on its relationship with Europe, not to mention access to funding from EU based VCs. 
""The UK, especially London, which at the moment is the world’s highest earning fintech sector, stands a very real risk of losing some of its most promising home-grown start-ups to other global hubs that would inevitably overtake it.""
Meanwhile, a straw poll of start-ups at Barclays’ Rise accelerator in the east of London shows concerns among the country’s new breed of entrepreneurs, ranging from access to talent, to pricing and the viability of their business model should the country decide to leave the economic bloc.
Another voice warning against Brexit is Simon Black, CEO of Ppro Group, who warns of the potential impact on cross-border e-commerce: ""Research reveals that by 2020 some 40.6% of all British e-commerce revenue will come from sales outside of its borders. Europe itself is expected to account for £16.7 billion of all e-commerce revenue for British businesses by the end of the decade. 
""If the Brexit was to go ahead, the viability of continuing our leadership in cross border e-commerce would be under severe threat, impacting the very livelihoods of digitally-minded British businesses.""
Hiroki Takeuchi, CEO of GoCardless, which processes $2billion payments for 20,000 businesses across Europe, believes damage has already been done by Brexit, regardless of the outcome:
“Whichever way the vote goes, we are already starting to see the impact of the referendum on UK startups. Potential US customers are holding off on signing contracts and their perception of London as a steady, stable staging post for the rest of Europe is coming into question.
“Early on in our company’s life, we were one of very few companies that chose to move back to the UK after Y Combinator, a US incubator programme. One of the key attractions in doing this was London’s political and geographical strength within the EU. If we had to make the same decision in a post-Brexit world, it’s hard to say we would make the same choice.”
Not everyone thinks that Brexit would be bad for fintech. Former minister of state for trade and investment Digby Jones recently wrote in City AM that the fintech boom means that leaving the EU won't hurt exports.
""The UK is in an exciting position at the epicentre of the fintech boom, and I believe financial technology solutions will act as a one-stop shop for international trade, securing payments and removing the need for letters of credit, currency hedging, insurance, legal advice and bank-led funding in one step,"" says Jones.
Meanwhile, Chris Gledhill of challenger bank Secco has used Finextra's pages to argue that the EU is a bureaucratic relic of the past, concluding: ""The EU is a burning platform and it's time the UK got off - for the sake of UK FinTech and the UK in general I believe now is the right time to leave the EU.""
Reflecting the unceratinty surrounding the vote, UK fintech unicorn TransferWise has announced plans to suspend GBP transaction on Thusday, citing FX volatility issues.

According to Reuters, since the referendum, challenger banks Aldermore, OneSavings Bank, Shawbrook and Virgin Money have fallen an average 37%, while the country's biggest four lenders have seen their price drop a relatively modest 21%.Yet, PwC says that nine of its 10 challenger clients that were planning to set up a new financial services firm before the referendum, are still committed, encouraged by the attractive returns achieved in the retail banking sector, the strategic direction of some incumbent global investment banks, a positive regulatory environment, and the potential of technology.Stephen Morse, financial services partner, PwC, says: ""We are working with approximately 20 prospective new banks and other large FS businesses looking to set up in the UK.

Virtual currency miners and blockchain software providers including smart contracts platforms, coloured coins, smart property, multi-signature software, and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets will not require a license to conduct business in the state.

""Increasing regulatory pressure for greater transparency and heightened concerns about tipping off the rest of the Street through information leakage could drive current users of electronic trading to execute a greater proportion of their total volume via the screen in the future,"" says Greenwich MD Andrew Awad. In fact, the European market has passed the US in certain fixed-income products when it comes to electronic execution.

The report finds that institutional investors are taking tentative steps to utilise new sources of liquidity to execute corporate bond trades and are forming new trading relationships through electronic trading platforms. The average number of dealers used is up 35% since 2009, although the market continues to be dominated by the top dealers.  Greenwich Associates estimates that 16% of institutional investment-grade corporate bond trading volume is executed electronically today, with four out of five firms utilising electronic trading platforms for some portion of their trading.

Growth in electronic trading of block trades - those over $5 million - will be a much more challenging endeavor, says the firm, as these trades are the ones that the buy side brings to dealers via phone, not only for market color and liquidity, but also to build up a relationship that ensures access to sought-after new issue allocations.

	In a new white paper, the DTCC predicts that the raft of new rules and requirements being brought in around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis could see rising margin calls running as high as 1000% and demand for collateral outstripping supply.The paper cites a Bank of England study which estimates that collateral demands could hit $800 billion and a ISDA calculation that new initial margin requirements for OTC derivatives could top $10 trillion.Yet, despite this approaching massive increase in demand, many financial firms either don't fully get what pools of eligible collateral they have or can't easily mobilise it. According to one study, as much as 15% of collateral is left idle, costing the industry more than EUR4 billion a year.The increased demand for collateral will not only increase costs, it will also ratchet up operational risk and overwhelm operational processes and system infrastructures, says the depository.In addition, technology changes will be needed to create comprehensive record keeping and reporting across the broad collateral environment of providers and services.Mark Jennis, MD, strategy and business development, DTCC, warns: ""Regulatory changes implemented over the past two years, and those still to come, have the potential to overwhelm firms and market participants with operational and risk challenges of a magnitude we have never seen before.""The DTCC is calling for strategic collaboration and a ""holistic"" approach on areas such as exposure calculation and margin management, portfolio margining, collateral optimisation, record keeping and reporting, communication standards, and reference data.""The reality is that collateral challenges will be far more extensive than what has been reported thus far, and in many cases, fragmented solutions will only address certain parts of the problem and may lead to unintended consequences,"" says Jennis.Read the full white paper:» Download the document now 1.1 mb (PDF File)

Aditya Gupta, OCBC Bank’s head of e-business Singapore, says: “We know that customers now prefer their banking to be embedded in other things they do, rather than having to start their interaction journey from a bank’s platform. We are integrating payments into our customers’ everyday lives and making it completely frictionless for them to engage us via actions that are second nature to them - using messaging and voice commands. The bank last month increased the OCBC Pay Anyone daily transfer limit from $100 to $1,000. ""Since then, the amount of money being sent via our e-payment service has increased 250 per cent,"" adds Gupta. ""We expect e-payments to have a multi-fold increase and will continue to add more payment channels for customers to our suite of digital services.”

	The German bank says the ability of machines to communicate and post production data and capacity constraints over the Internet is creating new business lending models, such as pay-per-use, pay-per-part and 'equipment-as-a-service'. The prototype platform was developed by the bank's recently established big data and analytics division in conjunction with networked machine tool manufacturer Emag and car parts supplier KMB Technologie. The loan repayment schedule is calculated based on the actual usage of capital equipment, which helps preserve the user’s liquidity. If machine utilisation is low, the repayment burden is also low. It follows, then, that if there is an increase in production - and a rise in turnover - the repayment rate for the pay-per-use loan also rises. “The pay-per-use loan from Commerzbank allows us to invest in a new generation of machines from Emag,” says Sven Hartwich, commercial manager at KMB Technologie. “With the flexible repayment rates we can adjust our liquidity for production and turnover. This in turn allows us to lower our break-even point further in order to achieve better overall financial stability.”

	Adopting a utility approach, the KYC blockchain was used to collect, validate, secure and share customer information on a permissioned ledger, eliminating the need for multiple form-filling by customers at different banks and eradicating inconsistencies in data gathering. The three banks on the platform were also able to store secured digital records of the validation process, thereby streamlining auditing and regulatory reporting.The prototype’s performance was tested between February and May 2017 for its functionality, scalability and security. Pranav Seth, head of e-business at OCBC Bank says the platform remained stable even with a high volume of information flow and maintained confidentiality by permitting access to the ledger’s information only with legitimate authentication.“This partnership fans the spirit of cooperation among competitors as well as regulatory and government bodies, and we hope this will help foster and inspire more of such collaborative innovation initiatives,"" he says.

	The two companies - BlackSwan Technologies and Silent Eight - were part of the second Fintech Accelerator Programme run by OCBC Bank’s innovation unit, The Open Vault. Taken together, the startups automate the process of researching customer profiles and analysing suspicious transaction flows between counterparties. At OCBC, this work is currently carried out manually by an internal compliance analyst, with the total time required lasting between one hour and a few days.The bank says that the application of AI tools speeds things up significantly - for instance, the “desktop” component of the research can be reduced from one hour to just one minute - and can ""increase the overall productivity of an analyst by 100%"".While Silent Eight helps to automate the desktop research process by compiling a 'dossier' on suspicious individuals, BlackSwan takes care of the suspicious transactions, mapping them to a network of related transactions to identify possible connections with other individuals or companies which may be atypical or previously unknown. Alex Ng, head of the bank's group transaction surveillance unit that led the pilot says: “We saw great potential in these two fintech start-ups. The Open Vault at OCBC Fintech Accelerator Programme gave us the opportunity to work closely with the fintechs during a short burst of three months, to experiment by providing them with anonymised real data to see how the solutions can meet our needs. We were not disappointed.”Besides the test runs with Silent Eight and BlackSwan Technologies, OCBC Bank also completed pilots with four other fintech start-ups in the accelerator programme, including the use of AI for life insurance purposes and in consumer marketing, and the creation of SME dashboards and smart financing tools.Pranav Seth, OCBC Bank’s head of e-business, comments: “The Open Vault at OCBC continues to focus on bringing the bank and the external fintech ecosystem together. This year, we deliberately kept our focus narrow, addressing specific customer needs and business areas.

	The HSBC study, surveying more than 12,000 consumers in 11 countries, indicates that a rising tide of technophobia is stalling mainstream adoption of new technology-based services. The bank says a lack of understanding and trust in technology is leading millions of consumers to shun new advances in banking services, such as fingerprint recognition, voice recognition and robo-advice.While four in every five people (80%) believe that technology makes their lives easier, less than half (46%) trust fingerprint recognition to replace their password, despite it being recognised to be at least five times more secure and significantly more convenient than traditional passwords.The report - which majors on a lack of trust in consumers attitudes to new technology - comes at an awkward time for HSBC, landing just a week after the bank's voice recognition software was successfully bypassed by a BBC reporter and his non-identical twin brother.Reflecting a deep-rooted ambivalence about the benefits of new technology among consumers, the study further found that people are twice as likely to trust a humanoid robot for heart surgery (14%) as they are to trust one to open a savings account (7%) and only 11% would rely on any type of robot, including chatbots, to open a savings account or provide mortgage advice.The data chimes with a new survey from Nationwide which found that 40% of consumers would rather discuss their mortgage needs face-to-face than go online to find the best deal.While HSBC uncovered a spirit of optimism around the progressive nature of technology among early adopters, the significant majority of people have never heard of new technologies, and if they have, they couldn’t explain what they do.John Flint, global chief executive of Retail Banking and Wealth Management at HSBC comments: “We have a role to play in building our customers’ knowledge and trust so that they see the value to their lives in adopting a new payments app or the latest biometric security.”To this end, the bank is to introduce over 3000 'Digital Champions' by the end of 2017, to tutor and encourage front-life staff to have positive conversations with customers about the benefits of digital banking services.

Echoing the claims of a data scientist working on IBM's Watson, Fras, in a blog, says robots give ""employees more time to focus on delivering great customer experience and performing more creative and complex tasks"".
'Virtual colleagues' are already at work in several areas of the business. Among them is Liv, at life and pensions, who has brought 80% faster process lead times, a 100% reduction in errors, and helped boost compliance.

	The rapid advance in technological innovation will cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape, says the organisation, in a new report based on a survey of chief human resources officers and top strategy executives from companies across 15 of the world's largest economies.In terms of overall impact, the report indicates that the nature of change over the next five years is such that as many as 7.1 million jobs could be lost through redundancy, automation or disintermediation, with the greatest losses in white-collar office and administrative roles. This loss is predicted to be partially offset by the creation of 2.1 million new jobs in tech-heavy “job families”, defined as computer and mathematical or architecture and engineering.Healthcare is expected to experience the greatest negative impact in terms of jobs in the next five years, followed jointly by energy and financial services and investors.As new technologies make “anytime, anywhere” work possible, companies are breaking up tasks in new ways, leading to a fragmentation of jobs across many industries. These effects are further compounded by the rise of mobile internet and cloud technology, enabling the rapid spread of internet-based service models.Drivers of change will have a disparate affect within specific industries, says the WEF. For financial services firms, processing power and big data, alongside the rising middle class and consumer ethics and privacy issues are seen as having the biggest impact. Skills instability is expected to be particularly pronounced in financial services where 43% of the top skills needed across the industry are expected to change by 2020. A strong demand for architecture and engineering and computer and mathematical job families, will be counterbalanced by a moderate decline in manufacturing and production roles and a significant decline in office and administrative roles.Data analysts, which companies expect will help them make sense of the torrent of data generated by the forthcoming technological disruptions, will be particularly prized.

	Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most controversial topics in the field of robotics. Ray Kurzweil believes that, by 2029, computers will be able to do all the things that humans do. Only better. Critics disagree, but the possibility continues to get closer.
No one can deny that the groundwork is there already. The amount of available data has increased to zettabytes. More and more, this ocean of data is well structured and available to us through a growing multitude of APIs. And, of course, there is the ever-increasing power of applied computing. Mix these three together in smart algorithms, and they produce models and patterns in real time that humans cannot create or comprehend. It’s easy to see how close we are to creating algorithms that surpass human capability.
Introducing the monster
The development of AI is one of the most exciting trends around. Frankenstein is not science fiction anymore. The Big Techs invest billions in AI Systems, e.g. IBM Watson, which understands the nuances of human language and the context of a question. Consider also Apple’s ubiquitous knowledge navigator Siri  or smart region-specific Cortana from Microsoft. They advanced from descriptive systems that produce information, into predictive systems producing insights and enabling better decision-making, to pre-emptive systems that are intelligent and learn on their own.
Embracing the change
In FinTech, the number of start-ups focusing on AI is rapidly increasing. Engineers and big-data scientists create new companies to offer advanced machine learning solutions for investment banking and cybersecurity solutions. But also in the field of Risk Management, the core function of every bank, predictive and prescriptive systems are introduced to produce more efficient risk models than the current more descriptive models.
In the next few years, we’ll probably see AI expand in Finance from back-end functions like overseeing trading decisions, detecting fraud, or risk analyses to the front-end functions like personal advice and much smarter ways to interact with a bank. For example, it could replace cumbersome questionnaires with natural dialogue. The ‘intelligent agent’ will offer better and faster personal service, 24 hours a day. It will help you with your insurance or investments, it will think along with you to decide which mortgage best suits your financial future, and it will alert you when something out of the ordinary occurs or may occur.
Preparing for the future
In the advanced version of this idea, clients – with the help of their personal banker avatar – will determine how their finances should be arranged, how much must be saved for the summer holiday this year, what the minimal balance on the household account should be, etc. The system will manage accounts and alert clients only when needed. Of course, it will also categorise transactions intelligently, provide feedback about financial health, and report on whether financial objectives are on track. These are all existing Personal Finance Management functions. However, in an AI reality, they will be more autonomous, user- and context specific, and will trigger clients with more intelligent insights and advice.
Providing the transparency
It will be interesting to see the acceleration of AI functionality in a context in which the new EU data protection regulation will be implemented. It is very likely that, by law, somehow the logic behind decisions and advice will have to be explained to the user. The robot advisor will have to be able to make the rationale behind his reasoning transparent. So apart from the ’how’ or ‘what’ it has to be able to answer, we can also ask a lot of ‘why’ questions to figure out the principles, hypotheses, rationale, logic, or thinking our robot advisor employed.
Of course, data protection and client security are also top priorities. We must explore all the ways to keep client data secure, while also making the most of the robots’ extreme processing power.
Remembering the client
ABN AMRO won’t be replacing human financial advisors with robotic ones tomorrow, but the concept is not as far-sighted as we might believe. And just how far AI will be adopted in the financial sector is as yet unknown. Will it remain a back-end tool that assists human advisors with providing ever-more accurate advice and projections? Or will clients embrace their financial avatars for their accuracy and availability? In the end, as always, those answers will depend on the client, and his or her willingness to adapt to the change.
But, by exploring and experimenting with this technology now, and preparing for the changes to come, ABN AMRO is doing the best thing we can do for our clients: learning everything we need to know to make the most informed choices when the time comes. As the creators of these sleek and shiny monsters, we have the best chance of preventing them from becoming our masters.

	The report says robots and other forms of artificial intelligence will take over 45% of all jobs in manufacturing and shave $9 trillion off labour costs within a decade, ushering in a new era of 'creative disruption'. Billing the coming upheavals as a fourth industrial revolution, the authors say rapid advances in technology will cause a paradigm shift in the way society lives and works. “The pace of disruptive technological innovation has gone from linear to parabolic in recent years,"" states the report. ""Penetration of robots and artificial intelligence has hit every industry sector, and has become an integral part of our daily lives.”While much of the disruption will be felt at the bottom ends of the labour market, middle class jobs are also set to feel the pinch, says Bank of America, pointing to the growing use of robo-advisors in financial planning as a prime example. The Millennial generation now 18-34 years old will be the first to switch en masse to these automated services, states the report. This rising cohort already holds $7 trillion of liquid assets and is likely to inherit another $30-$40 trillion from Baby Boom parents.

Around 60% of Bay Area-based Wealthfront's customers are under 35.Many of the traditional wealth advisors are taking note, and Bank of America is no exception. The firm is understood to have put dozens of employees to work on an automated investment prototype for Merrill Edge, which targets accounts under $250,000, according to a recent Bloomberg report.

To this end, the bank is engaging with IBM on the modifications and fine-tuning required to apply Big Blue's Watson supercomputer in a banking environment.Describing mobile payments as a ""priority"" area of investment, Sberbank is currently piloting the use of both stickers and microSD cards for transforming mobile handsets into NFC-enabled payment devices.The establishment of a special-purpose innovation fund marks an attempt by the bank to get in on the ground floor with a wave of promising start-ups using Internet-based technologies to re-invent banking. It is already working with US-based card tech firm Dynamics to test an initial order of 300-500 of the firm's programmable mag-stripe cards.The new fund will be looking to invest in similar companies that have come through the angel stage of investment and have a working product that can be put into production at a bank.""If we find them useful for us - we first do a pilot,"" says Mihaescu. ""So we do the due diligence. If it works out - we are going to make the company one of our suppliers. We are going to give them a huge reference account. We are going to give them validation.""He says the bank has already identified approximately 50 firms around the globe that it is interested in working with. He says that the initial $100 million round will be solely funded by Sberbank in concert with Troika-Dialog as a ""general partner"". ""Second and third fund will increase the overall volume of venture funds to $700 million total,"" says MIhaescu. ""For the fund where we are the main investor we will be mainly looking for large international banks to become limited partners with a smaller investment level.""

	The consultation paper from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) proposes to merge legislative rules under the the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (PS(O)A) and the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act (MCRBA), which govern stored value and remittances respectively. With new innovations blurring the lines between remittance and payments, MAS intends to create a single framework that will provide for the licensing, regulation and supervision of all payments services, including stored value facility holders, remittance companies, and virtual currency intermediaries.It is envisaged that regulation will be applied on an activity basis, and entities will only be required to apply for a single licence to undertake several payment activities. The proposed framework will also seek to strengthen standards of consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and cyber security related to payment activities. To co-ordinate the initiative and ensure interoperability, MAS proposes to establish a National Payments Council, which will draw its members from among users and providers of payment services. MAS deputy managing director, Jacqueline Loh, comments: “Payments is one of the key components of fintech and serves as a foundation for our vision of a Smart Financial Centre.

	In 2014 Singapore was one of the first countries in the world to build a 27/7, real-time interbank fund transfer system, called Fast.However, cash in circulation is 8.8% of GDP, compared to 4.4% in Australia and 2.12% in Sweden. Nearly 13 cheques per person were written in the country in 2014, compared to seven in Australia and effectively none in Sweden.According to research from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and KPMG, the social costs of this heavy reliance on cash and cheques is around 0.5% of GDP, or S$2 billion a year.In a speech, MAS managing director Ravi Menon says that the fact that Singapore is so far behind these other countries shows that the Fast infrastructure is ""grossly under-utilised"".One of the key reasons for this is that people do not know the bank account numbers of people that they want to send money to. Therefore, MAS and the country's banks are developing a Central Addressing Scheme (CAS) that will allow payments to be made through Fast using only a recipient’s mobile number, or NRIC number, or Unique Entity Number.""If all goes well, by this time next year, we will no longer need to remember bank account numbers for a majority of our electronic fund transfers,"" says Menon.In his speech, the MAS MD also says that cost is holding back the take up of Fast among small businesses. Some banks charge up to S$10 to transfer funds through the system while cheque payments are free.Menon also bemoaned Singapore's complicated point-of-sale situation, which sees many stores cluttering up counters with multiple terminals to accept different cards.To tackle this, the country is pushing ahead with a unified POS terminal that can read all kinds of cards at retail and hospitality outlets. About 1000 of them have been deployed at convenience stores such as 7-Eleven, with more to follow.Meanwhile, Singapore's Land Transport Authority is teaming up with MasterCard for a pilot that will see participants pay for their train and bus journeys by tapping their contactless credit and debit cards.On MAS's own role, Menon says that the central bank will streamline and strengthen the payments regulatory framework to create a single and modular regime that will be applied on an activity basis, rather than specific payment systems. KPMG's report also recommends strengthening the governance model and creating a national payments council that fosters innovation, competition and collaboration, coordinating key initiatives, such as promoting interoperability and adopting common standards.

Last year the European Central Bank called for a gradual approach to HFT while in the US a number of exchanges have looked to introduce so-called speed bumps to counter the trading advantages enjoyed by HFT firms at the expense of retail and mainstream investors.
it is not just the sense of unfair competition that bothers market supervisors but also the threat to market stability posed by ultra-fast trading services and software. However, it continues to be a divisive subject with others arguing that HFT provides valuable liquidity to the market and adds to its efficiency.
Japan's new law will possibly come into effect in early 2018. It will require any HFT participants to register with the FSA and to provide evidence of proper risk management systems. They will also have to either establish an office in Japan or a representative agent.
According to FSA figures, HFT accounted for almost 70% of orders on the TSE and just less than half of the traded value, just less than $2.9 trillion.

""Regulators are not there to develop strategy for the industry,"" says Kamellard.That this is where the Council and its roadmap come in, answering big strategic questions on issues such as moving to international standards and making further inroads on real-time payments. ""Then the regulator can look at both the questions and the way that they are being answered and say, either that's fine, in which case they'll focus on other areas. And if it's not fine they'll make it clear that it's not fine and we'll then address any concerns they may have,"" says Kamellard.From the banks' perspective, RBS's Simon Newstead says that there is no real distinction between how the new regulator and the roadmap are approached. ""It's hugely important...that we end up with a single roadmap"" for the next two to five years.Newstead says that there are a huge array of projects that the payments industry could embark on and so a key role for the PSA will be to establish what the priorities are, what to do and in what order.

	The crypto-currency community is currently reeling from news that troubled exchange MT. Gox appears to have lost nearly 750,000 bitcoins - worth hundreds of millions of dollars - to malleability-related theft.While the MT-Gox case may be unusual for its scale, research from Dell SecureWorks suggests that theft is rife as crooks look to cash in on the skyrocketing value of bitoin and other currencies.The research shows that the number of Windows-compatible cryptocurrency-stealing malware (CCSM) families has broadly tracked bitcoin's value, shooting up over the last six months.The most common type of CCSM is the wallet stealer, which searches for well-known wallet software key storage locations, either by checking known file locations or by searching all hard drives for matching filenames. Typically, the file is uploaded to a remote FTP, HTTP, or SMTP server where the thief can extract the keys and steal the coins by signing a transaction, transferring the coins to their address.Many wallet-stealer families also steal credentials for Web-based wallets, such as Bitcoin exchanges. Although several exchanges have implemented two-factor authentication using one-time PINs to combat unauthorised account logins, advanced malware can bypass this by intercepting the OTP as it is used and creating a second hidden browser window to log the thief into the account from the victim's computer.The researchers also warn that once malware is installed on a computer there is a good chance it will fail to be spotted, with an average unweighted detection rate across major antivirus providers of a little under 50%. With two-factor authentication and antivirus software largely ineffective at protecting virtual currency holders, Dell SecureWorks suggests using alternative wallets such as Armory and Electrum, which can protect against theft-by-malware by using a tricky split arrangement for key storage. Splitting involves one computer, disconnected from any network, running a copy of the software and holding the private key that can sign transactions, while a second PC connected to the Internet holds only a master public key of which addresses belong to the offline wallet. This computer can generate transactions, but it cannot sign them because it does not have the private key. A user wishing to transfer coins generates an unsigned transaction on the online computer, carries the transaction to the offline computer, signs the transaction, and then carries it to the online computer to broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

	While most of the infection activity has occurred in the US, the malware - dubbed ChewBacca - has also been spotted in the wild in in 10 other countries including Russia, Canada and Australia. RSA researchers discovered that, beginning 25 October, Chewbacca had logged track 1 and 2 data of almost 50,000 payment cards it had scraped from infected PoS systems.RSA says it has been in contact with victim companies and the FBI to shut down the command-and-control server logging the data and to share key forensics data. The ChewBacca Trojan featured simple keylogging and memory-scraping functionality to search for regular expressions of card mag-stripe data. If a card number is found, it is extracted and logged by the server.RSA's findings come as US retailer Target said that the recent breach of its POS platform that lifted details of over 100 million cardholders may have occurred through the use of a vendor's stolen credentials. Two other major US retailers - Neiman Marcus and Michaels - have also seen their POS systems attacked using similar malware engineering techniques.Target may be on the receiving end of $1 billion in breach fines levied by the Payment Card Industry Security Standard Council, according to an analyst note from Jefferies.

""They can increase staffing levels and develop leading-edge capabilities to detect and stop attackers via comprehensive monitoring and incident response, or they can encrypt or tokenize data at the point of capture and ensure that it is not in plaintext view on their networks, thereby shifting the risk and burden of protection to the card issuers and their payment processors.""

	In a blog post, Trusteer says it has found a two-step Web-based attack that allows fraudsters to change the mobile phone number in a victim's online banking account and reroute SMS confirmation codes used to verify transactions. Firstly, SpyEye steals the victim's online banking details in the standard Trojan style. It then changes the customer's phone number of record in the e-banking application to one of several random attacker controlled ones. To do this, the crooks need the confirmation code which is sent by the bank to the customer's original phone number. To obtain the code, SpyEye injects a fraudulent page in the customer's browser that appears to be from the online banking application. The fake page purports to introduce a new security system that is now ""required"" by the bank and for which customers must register. The page explains that under this new security process the customer will be assigned a unique telephone number and that they will receive a special SIM card via mail. Next, the user is instructed to enter the personal confirmation number they receive on their mobile telephone into the fake Web page in order to complete the registration process for the new security system.This gives the crooks access to all future SMS transaction verification codes for the account, enabling them to divert funds from the customer's account without their knowledge and without triggering fraud detection alarms.Says Trusteer: ""This latest SpyEye configuration demonstrates that out-of-band authentication (OOBA) systems, including SMS-based solutions, are not fool-proof. Using a combination of MITB (man in the browser injection) technology and social engineering, fraudsters are not only able to bypass OOBA but also buy themselves more time since the transactions have been verified and fly under the radar of fraud detection systems.""

	The malware targeting ING Bank Slaski was spotted by local security consultant and blogger, Piotr Konieczny, and picked up by F-Secure.
The security firm says the variant, Zeus Mitmo, appears to be the same type of man-in-the-mobile attack discovered by Spain's S21sec last year.
It is designed to steal one-time passwords sent over SMS, known as mTANs by injecting a ""security notification"" into the Web banking process on infected computers, attempting to lure the user into providing their phone number.
If a phone number is obtained, the user will receive an SMS link pointing to the mobile component, ZeusMitmo.A. If this is clicked on, crooks can intercept the SMS mTANs, enabling them to carry out transactions on the victim's account.
Separately, a new form of financial malware with the ability to hijack customers' online banking sessions in real time using their session ID tokens, has been identified by Trusteer.
Dubbed OddJob, the malware is being used by criminals based in Eastern Europe to attack the customers of unnamed banks in the USA, Poland and Denmark, claims the security firm.
OddJob enables fraudsters to carry out their crime without logging into the online banking computers - they simply ride on the existing and authenticated session.  The Trojan can also bypass the logout request of a user to terminate their online session. Because the interception and termination is carried out in the background, the legitimate user thinks they have logged out, when in fact the fraudsters remain connected.
Trusteer says it has been monitoring OddJob for a few months, but has not been able to report on its activities until now due to ongoing investigations by law enforcement agencies.

	In their paper 'majority is not enough: bitcoin mining is vulnerable', Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer warn that the entire bitcoin ecosystem is open to manipulation and takeover by a group seeking to maximise its reward, and that if this happens the entire currency could collapse.
Bitcoins are mined by networks of computers which have to solve cryptographic puzzles to create 'blocks', which are added to the 'blockchain' - a public ledger recording transactions.
Because solving the puzzles is hard work and therefore costs participants in power consumption, miners are compensated in bitcoins. Miners often band together to pool their computational power, sharing revenues whenever they find blocks.
The Cornell researchers say that the flaw at the centre of the process is that the bitcoin protocol assumes that miners are acting benignly - quickly and honestly sharing the blocks that they discover.
The pair say that if miners act selfishly and only tell the other members in their pool about block discoveries, the rest of the miners will waste their resources on blocks that are ultimately not part of the blockchain. Once enough blocks have been earned by the selfish miners they can publish their ""private"" chain, meaning that the honest miners' work is discarded.
If a pool of selfish miners is big enough - 33% of the computational power working on bitcoin generation - it will always be able to game the system. If this happens: ""Higher revenues can lead new rational miners to join selfish miner pools, leading to a collapse of the decentralised currency,"" warns the paper.

Launched in November 1983 by Nottingham Building Society with backing from Bank of Scotland, Homelink enabled customers to view statements, transfer money between accounts, pay bills and arrange loans online.
The system even included an e-commerce feature, letting customers compare prices and order goods from several retailers as well as arrange holiday's via Thomas Cook and send electronic messages to other Homelink users.
""The system was massively ahead of its time,"" says John Sinclair, an early Homelink user and a founder of The National Museum of Computing. ""I organised a mortgage through the system and it even pioneered an email-style messaging system with technology called 'viewlets'. These were essentially short messages which pre-dated the widespread use of e-mails by 15 years.""
The service tapped into the UK Post Office's Prestel Viewlink system and used a dedicated computer terminal connected to the customer's telephone and television.

The Tandata TD1400 Prestel System used for Homelink banking
According to a 1984 New York Times article on the service, Nottingham Building Society offered a $350 terminal for free to 12,000 of its wealthy customers while another 18,000 were tempted with a heavy discount.
In all, the building society and its two partners had spent around $15 million on Homelink - including on sponsoring the 1983 World's Strongest Man competition, won by Brit Geoff Capes - at the time the Times article went to press.
However, despite the investment, Homelink lasted only two years. Says Sinclair: ""It's a shame that the system died out by 1985 probably because of the cost of using online services at that time.""
With online banking now ubiquitous and mobile banking rapidly gaining users, Intelligent Environment is setting its sights on the next channel likely to take off - the smartwatch.
The vendor has developed an app which can be installed on any Pebble watch and lets users view their live bank balance and recent transactions, vibrating when the wearer's overdraft limit gets too close for comfort.
IE claims to be in discussions with a range of unnamed banks looking to roll out the Interact app to customers.

Once infected, the PC is sent various pieces of malware, one of which is designed to turn it into a bitcoin mining slave, harvesting coins for the crooks.
Bitcoins - which have soared in value over the last few weeks - are created by using computing power to solve cryptographic ""proof-of-work"" problems, with the miner rewarded with coins.
In a blog post, Kaspersky's Dmitry Bestuzhev says that the Trojan is getting more than 2000 clicks an hour, with most potential victims coming from Italy then Russia, Poland, Costa Rica, Spain, Germany and Ukraine.
With most anti-virus programs failing to pick up the malware, Bestuzhev advises people to check on their CPU because ""if you see your machine is working hard, using all available CPU resources, you may be infected"".

	The Slovenian national Computer Emergency Response Team says that it first began receiving reports that a gang was attacking firms in the middle of last year and built its case before raiding 12 houses and arresting five people this week.The gang sent e-mails purporting to be from local banks warning of late payments to accountants at small and medium companies. The messages contained attachments with malware, which, if clicked installed a RAT (Remote Administration Toolkit) on the computer, enabling the crooks to observe the activity on the infected system. According to Wired, all 48 victims were customers of the same, unnamed, bank which uses a card authentication system directly connected to the client's computer. If users left their card in the reader, the crooks could access their account with a keylogged password.The attacks usually happened on Fridays or the day before a national holiday, leaving the gang time to queue bank transfer orders unobserved.A group of around 25 money mules - recruited with the work-at-home scam in the name of a non-existent British insurance company - were used to transfer the money.

	While the paper concludes that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could not supplant traditional currencies to any significant degree due to scalability limitations, it opens out the prospect of central-bank backed digital coins as an alternative to the current fractional reserve banking system.Acknowledging that such a move would encourage consumers to switch their accounts away from traditional lenders and instead hold deposits in the new digital currency accounts, the report suggests that might not be such a bad thing.""To avoid recurrent instability of the banking system, commercial banks would need to come up with more reliable funding sources than deposits,"" states the paper. ""As the fractional reserve character of the current banking system can be a major source of instability, such a disruptive change is not necessarily a bad development, but could finally pave the way for a more stable financial system.""The report is at odds with guidance issued by the Bank for International Settlements, which argues that central banks should steer clear of developing their own digital currencies, billing the development as a move into unchartered waters with potentially serious implication for monetary policy and financial stability. Recent speeches by executives at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve bank of New Zealand have echoed the BIS policy stance. In an Australian Economists Briefing just yesterday, Tony Richards, head of the payments policy department of the Reserve Bank of Australia remarked: ""For the time being at least, consideration of a possible new electronic form of money provided by the Reserve Bank to households is not something that we are actively pursuing.

With everyday transactions migrating to digital channels, banks and building societies are shutting some branches and revamping others for the changing needs of customers.
Dalziel & Pow say that they have put ""humanity, openness and connectivity"" at the heart of their design for Nationwide, ditching the stereotypically austere branch aesthetic for something more homely and welcoming.

As Nationwide branch employees increasingly focus on advice, rather than transactions, the new design brings staff to the forefront by removing the physical barriers of closed counters and providing more open spaces.

There are four service zones: convenience, where members can use ATMs; conversation, for chats with employees; consultation, for private talks with experts, including via video link; and community, for local activities.

A handful of the new branches have already opened with more to come, says Richard Newland, director, branch and workplace transformation.
""We understand the importance of face to face, and that’s why over the next few years we’re investing in our network, to upgrade our branches, ensuring we’re in the right place, with the best services to meet our members’ changing needs. 
""Through this we’ll transform our brand on the high-street, creating spaces that are meaningful to our members and demonstrate our unique difference to the banks. The new 4C experience offers our members the choice and convenience to bank with us how they want to, and not only that, our colleagues are loving the flexibility of spaces too.""

Barclays is floating a RegTech proposition which tracks updates to regulations within the FCA Handbook and aligns their implementation to Barclays’ internal policies. First Direct is testing an app from Bud which learns customers attributes from transactional and demographic data to identify financial and non-financial products from a marketplace of first direct, HSBC and external institutions.

	Beginning today, Visa invites eligible participants in the MENA region to submit their business solutions that apply to one of the following three briefs:
Challenge #1. Acceptance Challenge. How can start-ups leverage Visa APIs for either:
·         Enabling smaller merchants to accept payments in-store digitally, OR
·         Providing a safe and secure solution for online merchants to drive ecommerce and reduce cash on delivery?
Challenge #2. Airport Transit challenge. How can startups leverage Visa’s APIs, mobile technologies and connected devices to transform their transit experience at airports?
Challenge #3. Loyalty Challenge. How can startups make it easier for consumers to select the right Visa card for their purchases and be notified about the right Visa offers and benefits at the right time?
Each challenge has been structured keeping in mind the niche dynamics of the local landscape. As the region’s domestic merchants rapidly expand their digital commerce proposition, payment gateways also must evolve at a neck-to-neck speed to offer their customers a hassle-free shopping experience.
MENA being home to the busiest travel hubs in the world, including Dubai International Airport which has introduced biometrics and other smart technologies, has significant untapped potential to make its travel experience simpler and faster.
Lastly, in an increasingly competitive startup market, loyalty programs have become one of the key ways to retain old customers and acquire new ones. Payment rewards being integral to these programs, have a lot of scope to become intuitive and responsive to cardholders’ needs.
One winner per brief will be selected, and each will receive a US$25,000 cash prize. Winners of the prize will be invited to a working meeting with Visa, and may be presented with the opportunity to create a prototype. Visa will then select one overall winner to receive an additional US$25,000.
Visa’s Everywhere Initiative is part of a global implementation that is strategically important to the global payments company’s goal of fostering the growth of next generation payment technologies. Currently, it has nearly fifteen hundred participating Fintech startups across North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.

	The deployment of the technology from big data startup Quantexa follows a pilot of the software with HSBC in 2017 which helped the bank to spot potential money laundering activity. HSBC had to pay a $1.9bn (£1.4bn) fine in 2012 for helping drug cartels launder money in Mexico and for contravening sanctions to do business with Iran. Alongside the payout, HSBC agreed a five-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) under which it promised to take action to correct compliance failings.The global lender has since spent more than $1bn tightening up its compliance procedures, including participation in a $3.3 million funding round in Quantexa in March 2017. Ray O’Brien, HSBC’s global risk COO and head of global risk analytics, says: “Following our investment in Quantexa, we are looking forward to working closely with the company to utilise its technologies as we become more intelligence led in our approach to financial crime risk management.” Want to learn more about how AI is upending traditional financial services?

	The Dynatrace APM is being put to work across the bank's entire IT stack, from mainframe to mobile, as the Dutch bank looks to get a more comprehensive picture of how, where, when and why customers connect with the bank. “In this digital age, the end user dictates which channels and applications are used for transactions and interactions. For example, one day a customer might use the smartphone app to transfer funds to a friend; the next day they use a desktop browser to access their online banking; and the following day they may even visit a physical high-street location to enquire about a new financial service,” explains Hans van der Net, service owner of monitoring, IT and data at Rabobank. “The point is, we need to monitor each and every one of these interactions to ensure we are delivering the most consistent and best customer experience possible,” he added.The move comes as the bank aims to streamline its operations and introduce a DevOps approach to product releases and upgrades.As a banking co-operative operating at both local and regional levels, the Dutch bank runs a complex network of independent IT platforms often performing the same functions depending on local practices. The bank recently constructed a 3D model of its own organisation and supporting IT systems to help visualise improvements that can be made as it embarks on its digital transformation programme.As van der Net explains: “Every department of Rabobank was running its own APM solution, which meant we had quite a disjointed response to performance problems.

	The agreement comes as Europe readies itself for the implementation of MiFID II on 1 January 2018, which will require all legal entities involved in a trade, including the executing, submitting or transmitting firm, on both the buy- and sell-side, to include LEIs in their European trade reporting.Using the DTCC's GMEI utility, SIX will be able to offer local entities the ability to register and renew LEIs in order to trade with European counterparties.Ron Jordan, managing director of data services at DTCC, says: “The true value of the global LEI system will be realised when regulatory reporting covering all asset classes in every jurisdiction is required to use LEIs to identify trading parties. We look forward to building a strategic partnership with SIX Securities Services - a positive addition to successful collaborations worldwide with CUSIP Global Services (CGS) and TMX’s Canadian Depository for Securities (CDS) in North America as well as NordLEI in Europe.”Despite initial enthusiasm for the programme, the global uptake of LEIs for tracking trading counterparties has so far been spotty. The first LEIs were issued in 2012 and by the end of January 2017 487,000 had been registered. But progress has stalled: in 2016 there were 64,000 issued but 76,000 lapsed.

	In late September last year, the Swiss post-trade provider entered a partnership with Digital Asset Holdings to explore the application of distributed ledger technology in financial markets. The prototype enables the issuing of bonds as smart contracts that specify at what dates coupon payments are made, for what amounts and how/when repayments occur. It includes the connection of the smart contract to the chain where buyers can allocate money by paying in digitalised currency to the address of the bond. The bond markets are seen as fertile ground for the live production of digital ledgers, promising significant cost reduction through the removal of operational and reconciliation processes and the reduction of settlement/counterparty risk and associated capital requirements.Interbank co-operative Swift has demoed a similar proof-of-concept for bond issuance across multiple geographies, connecting all participants to a trade on a single immutable network. SBI Securities and IBM and the R3 consortium have also been working to develop similar applications.In October, SIX issued research which suggested that regulatory uncertainty and a lack of inhouse expertise are proving major roadblocks to near-term adoption, forecasting a six-year timeframe before industry-wide applications of the technology would see the light of day.Thomas Zeeb, CEO SIX Securities Services: “Though still some way off for market-wide adoption, we are firmly of the belief that the potential shown here is promising - for us - and for the industry as a whole. I am convinced that what we have achieved with this approach could revolutionise several processes used by the Swiss financial services industry while sustainably securing our role in the provision of services throughout the Swiss value chain.”

The US-based firm also has a presence in the Swiss market, having acquired Zurich-based Elevence Digital Finance, a startup that has developed a modelling language for determining rights and obligations in blockchain collaboration agreements.At SIX, the initial phase of the project will demonstrate the ability to build and incorporate distributed, encrypted, straight through processing tools into existing securities transaction flows, and propose a roadmap for extending this to a production-ready service. The roadmap will additionally lay out a set of propositions for extending the technology across the post-trade ecosystem as a whole.According to Thomas Zeeb, division CEO SIX Securities Services: ""Distributed ledger technology and its potential role in post trading is key to our business. We need to understand it, and more importantly, its applicability and future flexibility in order to keep ahead of the game. Partnering with Digital Asset is a way to accelerate our own development plans and leverage their experience in this area.”SIX has already made a start on its own blockchain journey, developing a protoytpe application for corporate actions that will be on display at Sibos in Geneva next week.The Swift interbank financial technology show is set to be a hotbed of discusssion about the role of distributed ledger technology in the financial marketplace. In advance of the event, the co-operative has issued a new paper which examines the need for the financial industry to find agreement on the format of shared data, business processes, roles and responsibilities in the roll out of distributed ledger technology - and sets out its own position as an honest broker in the development of a common language. The paper outlines the necessary preconditions for standardisation of distributed ledgers and associated smart contracts, and the possibility of repurposing some of today’s existing standards. “The promise of DLT is the synchronisation of financial data between multiple organisations, whilst smart contracts can further provide self-executing efficiencies on the ledger,” says Stephen Lindsay, head of standards, Swift. “The paper recognises that full-scale standardisation of DLT/SC use cases is premature; however, Swift stands ready to work with the community to conduct further studies into the reuse of existing business standards in order to better facilitate the efficient workings of DLT/SC technologies for the financial industry as a whole.”

	In October, ING announced plans to invest EUR800 million in digital transformation initiatives over the next five years while shedding 7000 jobs. The plans marked an acceleration of the bank's two year old 'Think Forward' strategy to unify its operations on a single global technology platform.At the same time, ING’s chief operating officer (COO) Roel Louwhoff gained an extra job title: chief transformation officer (CTO), with a brief to unite the bank's platforms, processes, products, priorities and people and overcome potential stumbling blocks on the transformation journey. To this end, Louwhoff has borrowed from an idea first promulgated by Toyota in the car industry and set up an 'Obeya' room at ING's head office in Amsterdam. Obeya, which roughly translates as 'war room', is a Japanese programme management methodology designed to speed up communication and decision-making. Louwhoff explains: “This is the heart of ING’s transformation. The purpose is simple: having the full overview of the status of all projects and solving issues quickly. If an issue can’t be solved in five minutes, it’s escalated to the next level. You immediately see how everything fits together.”He describes the bank's transformations strategy as as huge shift in the history of the company, requiring a singular vision across all aspects of its business. ""We need to stop prioritising local goals and instead only think of the bigger picture,"" he says. ""And from sharing knowledge where everybody has a choice to use it or not, we now take the extra step by saying: we only build this once.”Louwhoff acknowledges that two years ago many in the financial services industry were complacent about the speed and scale of change that digitalisation was causing in other industries. Now, that disruption is impossible to ignore. “ING is one of the first big banking players who have seen this and have started to act,"" he says. ""We must remember that Alibaba wasn’t created in a few months. WeChat started four to five years ago. And we’ve only started this journey last year.

	Benoit, who is currently CEO of ING France, takes up the role in October, reporting to chief innovation officer Brunon Bartkiewicz.Faced with a wave of fintech firms that present both a threat and opportunity, banks have been busily formulating strategies on how to respond. A recent report co-authored by Santander called on banks and fintechs to collaborate in order to realise the potential for a 'Fintech 2.0' revolution.Many FS giants are already setting up accelerator programmes and establishing venture funds to invest in the most promising startups. However, ING appears to have set a precedent by tasking a senior executive with the role of point man for dealing with the fintech world. Benoit joined ING in 1994, although he did take one break to try his hand for a year in the startup world as a founding partner of an office supply firm, enabling him to boast on LinkedIn of ""(Un-)succesful Start-up experience"".In a brief statement, the bank says that the move ""illustrates ING’s determination to accelerate its innovation programme. Innovation is one of the key elements of the bank’s Think Forward Strategy.""Benoit is replaced at ING France by Karien van Gennip, previously director of private banking and investments, ING Netherlands.

In addition, the bank says it will reduce the number of contractors employed by 1075.

Unfortunately, the more efficient way of working will impact many of our employees.”Currently, ING uses different IT systems for mobile app, website, call centre and branches. The technology upgrade will help the bank to move to a cross-channel capability so that customers can be offered more relevant, timely, and pro-active service and advice, both remotely and in the branch. The bank says the cuts in staff will lead to a pre-tax provision of around EUR320 million in Q4, balanced by expected annual gross savings of around EUR270 million from 2018 onwards.

	Yesterday, the LSE insisted that it would not cave to EU regulators' demands that it divest its 60% stake in Italian bond trading platform MTS. This, the exchange said, meant that the watchdog was ""unlikely to provide clearance for the merger"" when it hands down its verdict on 3 April.
However, suspicion is growing that the merger is really falling apart because of tension between the UK and German firms over where the combined headquarters will be be located.
When the deal was first agreed, last March, London was named as the location of the holding company. However, the UK's Brexit vote just months later altered thinking in Frankfurt, leading Deutsche Bourse to seek a change.
With politicians in both countries pushing their respective agendas, the LSE recently rejected a Deutsche Bourse proposal for a dual holding company structure, with bases in both London and Frankfurt, according to the London Evening Standard.
Now the merger looks set to collapse, with one insider on the German side telling the Standard that the MTS factor is a ""weak excuse"".
If the two European powerhouses do fail to combine - for the third time this century - it is expected that American rivals Intercontinental Exchange and CME Group will consider bidding for them.

	Speaking at a New Year's reception, Kengeter said that while Deutsche Bourse's upcoming merger with the London Stock Exchange is grabbing all the headlines, it is just one part of a technology-driven growth agenda.He predicts that digital processes, new IT-based analytical tools for large amounts of data, and mobile devices are about to give the financial services industry a ""DNA transplant"".""Exchanges will have an altogether different design in five years’ time: they will be digital and data driven, and will be offering new services on this basis. We are focusing on cooperations to offer such services - with technology partners, with other capital markets players, with policymakers and with regulators."" With this in mind, last year the firm set up a dedicated fintech venture fund, DB1, and has already acquired digital foreign exchange trading platform 360T and taken stakes in other startups, including API specialist figo. Meanwhile, Kengeter also stressed the importance of data (market, big and smart) and AI in delivering new analytical tools to clients. Longer term, blockchain technology ""will trigger a true quantum leap"" for the exchange industry. Deutsche Bourse has already teamed up with Germany's central bank to develop a functional prototype for blockchain technology-based settlement of securities, while further prototypes in clearing and collateral management are also underway.On the LSE deal, with the spectre of Brexit in the air Kengeter stressed support for ""Europe's future cohesion"" and a bridge between London and Frankfurt.Separately, the boss of another German powerhouse, Deutsche Bank's John Cryan, has also been talking up the importance of technology.

	In another sign of increasing momentum in the German fintech sector, Hamburg-based fintech figo, provider of solutions and services to support firms’ PSD2 strategies, has snagged €6.8 million in Series B financing. In addition to German business angels, DB1 Ventures, the Corporate Venture Capital arm of Deutsche Börse, has handed over a seven-figure sum to secure a ‘significant’ minority stake.Figo is certainly in the right place at the right time with its proposition to build ‘the banking infrastructure of the future’. PSD2 is one of the drivers for a global move to open banking underpinned by open APIs, and incumbent banks will, whether they like it or not, be forced to open up access to account information in order to facilitate innovative new payment initiation and account aggregation services. Publishing APIs is one thing: integrating them into core systems is another. Given the legacy IT challenges faced by most banks across Europe, the demand for technology such as figo’s Banking API and other solutions in the context of PSD2 is likely to be high.For its part, Deutsche Börse sees the huge potential of PSD2 implementation, says its MD and head of Venture Portfolio Management and DB1 Ventures, Ankur Kamalia. ""In a changing financial landscape, figo has established itself as a reliable partner and has built up a fantastic fintech ecosystem around itself. We look forward to supporting their growth and also learning from the innovation they are driving,” he adds.Meanwhile figo reckons Deutsche Börse is a “perfect partner” says its CEO André M. Bajorat – given its neutrality and status as an infrastructure provider able to give figo “enhanced visibility”. The new funding will be used to push ahead with internationalisation of the company and to expand products for PSD2 and other regulations, he adds.For more insights into how banks are preparing for PSD2 and open APIs, check out Finextra’s latest research on the topic here.

	This interview was first broadcast on Brett King's Voice America radio show, Breaking Banks on Thursday, April 16th. You can listen to the full broadcast here.
The interview in its entirety can be heard here.

FINEXTRA: What is Anthemis’ core business – are you guys a traditional VC fund or more of an advisory firm?
NAUIOKAS: I think we are right in the middle of both. So our core business is, and has been since its inception, one part advisory - where we take a role of senior advisor to a whole host of financial services organisations and institutions that are looking to digitise the future of their business. Separate to that we have an investments business that is a portfolio and managements business for entrepreneurs and startups and early stage companies in this space that are looking to solve the problems that financial institutions are recognising are opportunities.
FINEXTRA: What is your personal vison for the future of financial services?
NAUIOKAS: To think about the future I think a bit about the past. Sean [Park] and I built our careers in Wall Street firms on the back of financial technology. We weren’t just contrarians or new minded thinkers we were kind of ‘crazy people’. Half the time we would come and people would hold up their hands and say ‘here they come again these people who are going to convince us why ‘the future is now and everything is broken!’.
FINEXTRA: But you were crazy people who came from established banks.
NAUIOKAS: Thanks right, inside the status quo so to speak. Our jobs were to be the disrupter, to be the contrarian to be the new ideas. I think what happens is you eventually become an evangelist and other people start to listen to you and talk with you and then there are others that believe in you and then people start to listen. And the trend now, and certainly in the last couple of years – that has been significantly different.
The reason why we are seeing so many folks say they are jumping into this space as investors is the market is really beginning to understand and appreciate this opportunity in a way that they never had before.
And so now, all those crazy contrarian thinkers are actually becoming influencers, it is a wonderfully wonderful place to be in as a professional, but also for Anthemis because we have been committed to this for so long and we have a track record both on the advisory and the investment side. But the real difference when you see a trend like this is – if the participants in the market that need to be the change agents are also seeing a need for change. Then you know something going to happen.
From our perspective, it is a fantastic collaborative time. Big bank institutions are ringing us up on a regular basis talking about ways we’re going to collaborate, ways they can involve themselves with some of our portfolio companies and just ways they can think about the future. That is a very different picture than say five years ago.
FINEXTRA: Was being a contrarian in a traditional bank an uncomfortable place to be?
NAUIOKAS: For me it was never uncomfortable, I have never been a business-as-usual manager. I think ‘square peg/square hole’ wouldn’t have worked for me in any environment. I think that I have had a lot of success in the roles that I have had simply because I was willing to speak my mind and come up with new ideas and visionary thoughts that other people may not have been looking at.
That said, you know, the Athemis dream and the idea of going out on one’s own really typically comes at a time when you sort of see an opportunity that you feel is too big to pass up and if you stay inside you may not be able to take advantage of it as much as you could if you went on the outside. For me, it’s about being part of an environment that will reward value and appreciate the skill sets that I bring to the table as oppose to a structure that limits your own growth.
And I think being a senior woman in FinTech during the 90s and 00s – the opportunity to start my own thing made a lot of more sense to me than going up the chain of command, so to speak.
FINEXTRA: So what brought you back to Anthemis?
NAUIOKAS: It was a bit of serendipity and a bit of a too much of a good opportunity to pass up. Sean and I started what is now Anthemis in 2009. When Nadeem [Shaikh] come on to start the advisory business and grow the platform, it allowed me to follow my own dream and start a media company in the states, which I have been doing for the last few years. When I moved back to London, my intention was to take a bit of a sabbatical year - a thinking year - less doing more thinking.
As luck would have it Sean and Nadeem and I got together in the fall and they presented me some of the opportunities that were extremely hot for the picking - both on the investment side and the advisory side. To be fair I had been a part of the group up until that point – I had been an investor, been on the investment committee, I’d been part of the advisory unit – but it wasn’t until I sat down with Sean and Nadeem and saw the stars in their eyes and all the wonderful stuff that is happening in this world.
Part of it was, as you said, this massive interest in FinTech right now. We’re cool now. If I had a dime for every time I ran into someone on the street who was an ex-colleague, who says ‘oh now I’m doing angel investment in FinTech’ and we have a laugh on what their definition of what FinTech is. And I stand there and think: ‘if I am really going to do anything in FinTech, I only have one horse I’m going to back’ and Anthemis was the obviously choice.
It’s exciting, it’s an exciting time. What with what the team has built is phenomenal. The platform is fantastic. The demand is through the roof. It is always a great place to be. You’re right, they are listening now, and they are paying attention. It is a great time to be part of those conversations.
FINEXTRA: What drives you personally?
NAUIOKAS: I’m motivated by doing good work. I’m motivated by being appreciated for the work that I’m doing. And I think I am motivated by helping people execute their vison at pace.
I think for me that is one part, taking what Anthemis has built and help taking it to the next level, but also with the entrepreneurs and the startups that we’re funding and supporting and incubating. There is something about meeting someone who has an unbelievable idea, but just can’t quite figure out how to execute it. That is always something that has come very easy to me. And I think in the VC space it is a great skill to have. If you can put a team together, identify an idea and help them build a plan that they can execute at pace than that is a win win for everybody.
FINEXTRA: How do you bring your experiences from outside the banking world into the FinTech space?
NAUIOKAS: I think a few years ago I would have been quick to justify and defend all the different parts of my life and how they all play together. Interestingly enough, in the last 18 months I haven’t had to do that very often and I think it’s because people are appreciating that the trends that are driving financial technology or media technology or consumer behaviour – are all converging now. And if you can look at a product and a service from a customer’s perspective and recognised that the customers have changed. Their appetites for how they consume information has changed. Their appetites for how much interactivity that want to have, with whatever it is that they are doing, has changed. Even their knowledge base has changed. In the financial services world, that mean everything has changed.
But it is not that dissimilar to how people are consuming media and people are consuming any product and service. That is a significant shift and it gives some power back to the consumer in a way that I think has probably always been true, but I don’t think companies have recognised the need to pay attention to that consumer demand.
FINEXTRA: Why do banks seem to have difficultly seeing their products from a customer point of view?
NAUIOKAS: I grew up inside financial services largely as a marketer. Marketing has historically never been a field that people have valued inside of a number crunching, bottom line oriented space. I think that is changing. It’s certainly changing in banks. Some of the biggest success stories inside financial institutions right now is coming out of the retail sector where they are appreciating customer appetites - whether it be with the payments business or insurance – it is just a general understanding that what the customer wants, we need to deliver or they will go elsewhere.
The viewpoint I’ve always had has always been ‘customer centric and customer first’ – it’s end goal and how do we get there.
Historically I think the reason why it hasn’t mattered as much is, quite frankly the same reason I suggested that the structures of some of those organisational weren’t ripe for innovation was that ‘they were just too rigid.’ And there was too much of a focus on the bottom line without a focus on how do you get to that bottom line.
FINEXTRA: Is the idea that ‘the customer will go elsewhere’ not understood in banking?
NAUIOKAS: It is probably one part of a need to appreciate that there is a lot of pressure and a lot of deliverables on the plate of a banking executive right now. Sometimes it is hard to [remember] that at the end of the day we are actually serving customers - whether that is in the institutional markets or the retail markets or the wealth management market. I think the focus on regulatory reform and the focus on this level of due diligence and management has actually been really great for the customer.
I’m not saying that shareholders are not important. Shareholders are corner to any CEOs job from a day to day basis. If you focus on the product and focus on the customer the shareholders will win. Because you will deliver a better service you will deliver a better product and your customers will pay you back in spades. They’ll be purchasing more of your product, they’ll be participating more in your environment and therefore the shareholders will win.
I think what ends up happening sometimes is that there is a need to be so myopically focused on one part of the puzzle that you forget the others. I do think that is changing. I think even just the demand we’ve had from banks and financial institutions who reach out to us to talk about product design and customer acquisition and various forms of customer adoption from a knowledge perspective and that is actually a great thing.
FINEXTRA: What advice would you give a startup?
NAUIOKAS: First and foremost appreciate your own strengths and weaknesses. Surround yourself with a team that balances and compliments you. A typical and dangerous strategy from an entrepreneur’s perspective is when you see someone with a wonderful idea, who thinks they’ve got the plan, and then they surround themselves with everybody that looks just like them.
We’ve all had this conversation, whether it is diversity of ideas, diversity of opinions, and diversity of life experience – there is a lot more collaboration and success that come from a team that has complimentary skill sets and complimentary viewpoints. So I would certainly suggest that they think of their team first.
And be very careful about who you partner with. There is a lot of capital in the markets right now and that is a good thing it means that this is a robust environment for entrepreneurs, it is a robust environment to support ideas. But just because the money is there doesn’t mean you should be taking it.
Entrepreneurs have the ability now to step back for a second and talk about what that partnership means and what this money means and what that money allows them to do in the future, with that partnership. At Anthemis we take a long term view of our companies. One of the reasons why we love early stage and start up investing is we can be in early – we can help formulate ideas we can help and watch the company grow. But we are also capable as executives that have been inside large growth public companies, we know what happens at every stage. We can be their partner all the way through the process. It is easy to think there is some great capital and the strings don’t seem that difficult so I will go ahead and grab it.
Look at the quality of the money and the long term partnership that you are getting into a relationship with.

Of these, 8.5 million operated mainly through their mobile devices, up 45% y-o-y.BBVA executive chairman Francisco Gonzalez, says: “We have 8.5 million customers who use their mobile but the important factor is not the number but rather the rate of growth.

Therefore the pace of digital transformation is going very well.”Prominence was given to the number of sales made, with 19.2% of new consumer credits in Spain sold virtually, rising to 29.6% in Mexico.The transformation process accelerated in 2015 thanks to the new structuring that was announced in May, accompanied by new strategic priorities, says the bank. At the same time the BBVA Group continued to launch digital products and incorporate new digital businesses.

Last year Jeff Dennes joined the team to lead its charge into the digital era. He talks to Finextra about what being a chief digital officer entails and the bank's relationship with the fintech community.  
	Q: Francisco Gonzalez, chairman of BBVA Compass parent BBVA, has said that in the future the bank will be a software company. How do you, in your role, contribute to making this a reality?
A: As the Chief Digital Banking Officer, my role is to transform BBVA Compass into a fully capable digital bank, ensuring that we are leveraging best practices and solutions across the BBVA Group. I’m working with my team to create an anywhere, anytime, all-the-time customer experience, and that begins with a “digital first” development mindset. Customers expect to be able to conduct their financial lives online and so we must begin thinking about products and product design in that way – how can we make their lives easier by using digital channels? The most recent product we launched to support this was our ClearSpend prepaid card, which comes with a budgeting app. The product was designed to provide clients better control of their finances in a convenient, easy-to-use way.
Q: What’s the role of the branch in the era of online and mobile banking?
A: Branches will play an important role, even in the face of an increasingly digital world. We see them transforming into something akin to a retail delivery store, a place clients visit when seeking assistance with more complex banking needs. Q: How do you think the relationship between established banks, fintech startups, and larger tech firms such as Apple and Google will develop?
A: We see fintech as partners in the ongoing banking revolution, changing the way we deliver solutions to clients. I think the relationship between banks and fintech startups is symbiotic, not unlike their relationship with big tech firms like Apple and Google, which can provide platforms for digital disruptors to reach their customers.  BBVA Compass works with fintech startups in a variety of ways, whether through acquisition, like with Simple, investment through BBVA Ventures or commercial agreement. Globally, BBVA also holds a startup competition, BBVA Open Talent, which just wrapped its seventh year. We want to take banking in the 21st century in a bold direction, and the bottom line is that we will be collaborating with these startups and industry disrupters to do just that.
Q: BBVA Compass has opened up its platform to payments network Dwolla. Why did you make this move and what results have you seen?
A: Dwolla’s real-time network fits well with BBVA Compass’s real-time core banking platform, giving BBVA Compass account holders the ability to bypass conventional networks, reducing the time it takes to clear payments to seconds instead of the typical 2-5 business days. For us, working with Dwolla was both a way to further our own digital transformation and give tangible evidence of the impact of a real-time economy to consumers and businesses.
Q: How closely do you work with Simple? Have you found that their startup mentality and approach is significantly different to BBVA Compass’s?
A: Simple is a digital banking alternative that empowers users to better control their finances and it has created a new standard of customer experience. Acquiring Simple fits well with BBVA’s overall plan to lead the banking industry in digital transformation and grow in the U.S., with the understanding that both companies would be committed to Simple’s autonomy.  Even so, we do share best practices and plans are underway to migrate Simple’s customers to BBVA Compass’s  core platform.
Q: BBVA Compass economists recently claimed that the blockchain could become banking’s biggest disrupter. Do you agree and how do you foresee the technology changing the FS industry?
A: I agree with our economists that the blockchain has very real potential to change the way goods and services are paid for and exchanged, and anticipate we’ll continue to learn more about this as the technology advances.

By setting the bar for applications so loosely, the Treasury is in real danger of undermining the ultimate goal of the fund which is to cut RBS’s market share and stimulate competition away from established high street banks, says Boden.“The RBS fund has a chance to help truly disrupt the market by supporting real innovators. Because they are starting from scratch, building their own proprietary technology from the ground up and based on consumer needs, they can deliver more with certainty at a lower cost and in less time,"" she writes. “They can give SME customers accounts that can be opened in a matter of minutes without the traditional bureaucratic trappings of business banking which favours bigger companies. But there remains a risk that it could merely further entrench the big players, at the cost of entrepreneurs and small business owners.”",11412,2,453

Miguel Sard, managing director of mortgages at Santander says: “For most people, a mortgage is one of the biggest financial commitments they will make in their lifetime. We know that customers value speaking to a mortgage advisor who will explain what options are available to them and recommend a product to meet their individual needs.”He says that the bank plans to further extend the service later this year by enabling customers to connect onscreen with a mortgage advisor from their own PC. Video is becoming an increasingly important tool for banks looking to ensure the personal touch in the digital era. A recent survey of nearly 300 FS professionals from vendor Vidyo found that almost 20% have deployed at least one form of video banking, more than 40% are piloting one, and more than 80% are planning to offer the tech in the future.In the UK, Nationwide, Lloyds and Yorkshire Building Society are among the banks to have adopted the technology over the past year.

With the boom of robo-mortgage advisors beginning, it’s increasingly important for established lenders to invest in technologies to improve customer experiences.”Barclays topped the charts among the UK's big high street lenders with a 95.05% user experience score, closely followed by Lloyds (91.83%) and TSB (91.15%). In the intermediary market, supermarket chain Tesco beat out its banking peers, scoring full marks for its ""simple yet delightful site full of modern UI patterns"". Lusted adds: “Barclays and Tesco have clearly invested heavily in their mortgage UX, their attention to the small detail really pays dividends to the end user and their business.”Craig Calder, director of Barclays Mortgages comments: “We’re really proud to see that the online access and experience for our mortgage customers has been highly rated. We understand that buying and selling a home is not always straightforward, however, we want the mortgage experience to be a stress-free process.

	Shares in PayPal slid 12% in after hours trading following the announcement. In an earnings call with investors, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman sought to play down the impact: “Both our 2018 and our medium-term guidance already includes the anticipated economic impact of the eBay transition, which is quite manageable over a multi-year period. As such, we see no need to change our medium-term guidance. Given our long history with eBay buyers and sellers, both Devin Wenig and I believe a manageable transition and sustained relationship is in the best interest of our mutual customers.”PayPal was spun out of eBay in 2015 and his since been ploughing its own furrow, cutting relationships with card schemes and big technology firms in an effort to reduce its reliance on its former parent. Buying and selling on eBay currently accounts for about 13% of PayPal volumes, a figure which has been going down over time as the company moves into new markets.The switch to make Adyen the primary checkout option will take place in 2020, with PayPal dropping down the rankings to become a supplementary service.The move is a big boost for Adyen, which in 2016 increased transaction volume 80% year-over-year, to reach $90 billion. The company has been profitable since 2011, growing its earnings from $46 million in 2015 to $87 million in 2016. It ws valued at $2.3 billion following an investment round in September 2015 that drew support from some of Silicon Valley's biggest names, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey.eBay has also begun making significant investments across its business to build the capabilities required to reduce its back-end reliance on PayPal and intermediate payments across its own platform. The company’s payments team is led by Alyssa Cutright, VP of Payments, and Jingming Li, VP of Payments Platform, to oversee the business and product development. Over time, eBay expects to have a team of several hundred business, product, and risk specialists driving its payment capabilities.

	Specifically, the alliance of 74 fintechs, challenger banks and fintech associations is unhappy that the Regulatory Technical Standards on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication under PSD2 allow banks the possibility to be exempted by their National Competent Authority from having to accommodate licensed Third Party Payment Services Providers (TPPs) to access accounts via the so called fallback option in case of malfunction of the API.
""This is indeed a novel approach - we are not aware of any other case when new competitors in an industry have been obliged to rely on a specific API controlled by the incumbents,"" says a statement.
The latest missive is part of a long-running struggle between the fintechs and banks over the shape of PSD2 after authorities decided last year to outlaw screen scraping in favour of bank-led access to client data under APIs.
The alliance makes clear its fear: that banks will deliberately minimise the functionalities and information available in their APIs as a way to stymie the TPPs.
With this in mind, it says that the EC, EBA and ECB have a ""heavy responsibility"" to ""ensure that any API offered by banks has the adequate functionalities and performance, and works in practice"" if they want the objectives of PSD2 to be realised.

The decision to move one of CEO Brian Moynihan’s top lieutenants closer to Silicon Valley is designed to build relationships with tech firms as BofA seeks to win a bigger share of the fast-growing but competitive mobile payments sector.
Nguyen told the Wall Street Journal that he will be looking at partnerships with tech firms but also possible acquisitions of fintech startups, a departure for BofA, which has not bought a single company since 2009.
Moynihan instituted a 'no acquisitions' policy after the bank got its fingers burnt during the financial crisis but has now decided to make an exception for smaller deals related to fintech - one of the few obvious growth opportunities in the industry, says the Journal.

PayM has published its statistical update running to the end of 2015. I have listed my key take outs below. PayM growth has slowed down substantiallyWe can see that the rate of growth of registered users has decreased in 2015. There have been 139k less registrations in Q2 2015 vs Q2 2014, i.e 18% less registrations (see graph below) 17% of mobile banking users are registered to PayM?As of end of 2015 the Paym registrations stand as just above 3M.So is that big or small? Let's do some rough maths. I think there must be circa 18M mobile active banking users in the UK. Hence that means that ~17% of UK mobile banking users have signed up to Paym. That's not bad really within a 2.5 years period.Average transactions value down by 11%Average transaction value has decreased substantially in the last quarter of 2015 - according to PayM it's due to the volume of transaction increase.Low number of transactions per usersThe average number of transactions per registered users is growing on a quarterly basis, but remains very low. In view of how active mobile users are, 0.26 transactions every 3 months per registered users is not very much. I suspect that many registered users are inactive, it will be interesting to see if there are indeed users that love paym so much that use it when they can avoid using another payment method. (note: I don't believe this to be the case)ConclusionPayM is still a marginal payment method. There might be 17% of mobile users registered, very few of them bother using Paym it seems. Is Paym a failure considering the substantial amount of money it has costed bank to implement? Or do you believe that it will emerge as a credible payment method for a niche set of users and usage scenarios? I tend to lean to the former at this stage based on the set of publicly available data points.So Paym is definitely not a success, is it a failure? That might be a bit too harsh at this stage, we need a couple of more quarters to assess.I am interested to hear your perspective on this.You can find the fully Paym stats here.Hakim is available for interim roles and consulting projects on digital product management, strategy, proposition development and transformation in Fintech and retail banking.

	Recently a young high-tech entrepreneur was in my office, and very frustrated. He urgently needed to issue special bank guarantees for a supplier in Asia to rush a shipment. The delivery was a critical component for a new system he was developing. Everything else was in place except one minor detail: no bank guarantee and therefore no way to meet the deadline. Fortunately, LeumiTech was able to support this entrepreneur so he didn’t miss out on an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to keep his start-up afloat.Securing financing for this early stage technology company was clearly make or break. What was even clearer was the immense difficulty that this entrepreneur experienced trying to obtain financial support. This is because while the high-tech industry has seen unprecedented global development, our traditional financial systems haven’t adjusted to keep pace. Banks are conservative organisations who are bound by regulation and process, so when banks encounter the high-tech industry, complete with variable risk factors and fast-paced, agile operations from all over the world, it’s often a shock to their systems. First time founders of early stage technology companies tend to have minimal financial experience. In many cases it may be the first time they are opening a corporate bank account and it’s often unlikely they’re familiar with the world of credit facilities and bank guarantees.Worlds apartThe needs of emerging high-tech enterprises are worlds apart from more traditional corporations, which banks are more accustomed to. Many start-ups, for example, operate around the clock, and so business hours are long and with abundant financial needs. Start-ups also rarely have a Chief Financial Officer in place and will almost always begin operating at a loss and in constant search of funding.Banks serving these businesses must genuinely understand these needs and adapt their approach to give the start-up the best chance of achieving the best results - from the financial products and services it provides, to the skillset of the staff it employs. Even the language of entrepreneurs is not compatible with the typical banker. The key to bridging these gaps lies with the bank’s willingness and ability to learn how the new high-tech ecosystem operates. Only this will allow a universal, genuine understanding between bank and customer.The road to high-tech high growthThe high-tech ecosystem consists mostly of start-ups founded by young individuals who crave personal, direct and around-the-clock contact with their financial adviser. This builds a close relationship where the banker is intimately acquainted with the business, its characteristics and its managers. The bank can then guide the start-up and support them with their financial needs from the initial stages of development. To deliver an adapted service, the banker has to be in a position to provide overseas banking services, facilitate the execution of complex digital banking transactions and to offer solutions typical for the investor environment of the high-tech world, like venture capitalists. Banks must provide a carefully tailored package of financial services for each stage in the start-up's lifecycle.A high-tech bank must also support its customers throughout the company’s development, advising them on how to safeguard investor funds and make optimal use of money received. The bank will likely need to support the company through various aspects of geopolitical trends, changes in tax policies in different countries and grapple with the impact of macro processes on the business. In addition, banks specialising in high-tech should offer customers links and connections within the industry to potential investors and designated platforms.At a pricing level, banking that is properly tailored to the high-tech world will know to offer customers a flexible and individually tailored cost structure, bridge loans to tide them over until raised funds arrive from investors or from government grants, as well as specialised credit products. For example, when evaluating a credit deal, the creditor must take into consideration the lengthy development period and the sizable investments these companies must make. High-tech companies essentially ""sacrifice” profitability for the sake of high growth rates (growth of tens and even hundreds of percent per year). If banks fail to adapt their credit policies to meet the needs of high-tech companies, they will fail to provide the right credit solutions.Start-ups need a bank that genuinely understands its customer. This may not be simple when each customer has unique characteristics, but if the bank is willing to adopt a high-tech mentality, and accept the risk profile in order to support this unique ecosystem, then banking should only help start-ups to succeed.

	The Clearing House announced in October last year that it was preparing to undertake a multi-year effort to build a new real-time processing platform, as the country finally begins to get to grips with its aging payment systems. The plans are part of a wider movement to overhaul the US's antiquated payments infrastructure.The Clearing House says the ISO 20022 standard real-time payment system will be designed to address gaps in transaction processing and will enable consumers and businesses to securely send and receive immediate payments directly from their accounts at financial institutions. The move demonstrates a sea-change in thinking among US financial institutions, which have been left behind as other countries have adapted their payments infrastructures to cater for the needs of digital consumers and businesses.But with the pace of innovation showing no signs of slackening, the Federal Reserve has been pushing the industry to address the significant threats and opportunities that could arise from a move to update the payments rails to incorporate Faster Payments and improve security. “Building a real-time payment system is centered around meeting customer needs,” says Jim Aramanda, CEO of The Clearing House. “I am confident that working together with VocaLink we can build the most innovative and widely used real-time payment system in the world.” The contract is a major coup for VocaLink, which designed, built and manages the real-time technology behind the UK Faster Payments Service on behalf of the Faster Payments Scheme. Since the service was launched in 2008, over 4 billion payments have been securely processed and the real-time infrastructure has provided a platform for further innovation, driving the development and proliferation of a wider range of services, including mobile payments. VocaLink has sought to extend its technical know-how to other markets, missing out on a deal with Australia to international messaging network Swift, but winning out in Singapore with the implementation of the Fast payments service. Separately, the US bank consortium behind the clearXchange network are to form a combination with bank-backed risk and authentication utility Early Warning to enable consumers to send money securely and in real-time.As part of the transaction, US Bank and PNC are expected to join Bank of America, BB&T, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo as owners of Early Warning.

	Leumi may be taking aim at the younger generation with Pepper but a survey of 10,000 millennials shows that in fact fewer than half use banks' mobile apps. This, suggests Leumi, may be because respondents have higher digital expectations than older people and want a more fulfilling experience. To tackle this, from early next year Pepper will have Playbuzz’s suite of interactive formats - such as polls, quizzes and flip cards - embedded into its app to improve user experience and engagement through personalised content. The survey results suggest this could pay off because millennials are very engaged with their finances. Over 80% know what's going on with their current accounts and almost 70% think a few years ahead financially. This chimes with another survey of over 20,000 16 to 25 year olds by Reevo and Good Rebels, which finds that nearly three quarters have savings or investments and on average aim to set aside 20% of their monthly earnings. Although nearly one quarter (23%) of those surveyed use a banking app (for comparison, just 6% said they use the popular dating app Tinder), most agreed that these apps lack the functionalities they require. In their own words: “Banking apps have been the same since they were launched, all you can do is check your balance and generate security codes”; and “I am not content to stay with a bank that is behind the technology curve.”Lilach Bar-David, CEO, Pepper, believes the collaboration with Playbuzz will he help the bank overcome these perceptions.

	Banking via bots is currently very much in vogue, with banks rushing to roll out out conversational AI technology that will allow customers to manage their money and make payments in popular messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.However, Forrester's research shows that while bots can be effective in some circumstances, today's bot technology often leads to uneven — or worse — experiences for banking customers, either failing to complete the consumer’s request or providing a clunky, awkward experience.

	The Bank of England's 2017 stress test shows the UK banking system is resilient to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, large falls in asset prices and a separate stress of misconduct costs.That's the headline result. But buried beneath the wealth of data is an under-reported exploratory scenario which for the first time examined major UK banks’ long-term strategic responses to an extended low growth, low interest rate environment with increasing competitive pressures spurred by the use of digital technology.Rather than informing regulators about the immediate capital adequacy of participants, the exercise was designed to encourage banks to think about their strategic challenges. These could include a material downgrade on the £3.4 billion in fees earned by banks from overdraft charges and payments, as consumers use smart budgeting tools and alternative providers to better manage their finances.While the analysis assumes the competitive pressures from fintech could lead to a reduction of £1.1 billion in banks’ aggregate profits by end-2023, the Bank of England believes that may be an underestimate, identifying three important risks to the bank's projections. ""First, competitive pressures enabled by fintech, and in particular the emergence of Open Banking, may cause greater and faster disruption to banks’ business models than banks project. ""Second, banks are projecting large reductions in costs and there is a risk that they will be unable to execute these plans fully while delivering a broad range of services, particularly given that the cost of maintaining and acquiring customers may be higher in the scenario. ""Third, in an environment of low growth and low interest rates the equity risk premium may be higher than banks expect.""At a press conference announcing the results of the tests, BofE governor Mark Carney speculated that in the future financial apps, rather than banks, could become the first point of contact for consumer financial services, leaving banks as mere back-end utility providers.

	Initially financial institutions viewed FinTechs as ‘barbarians at the gates’ - a threat and FinTechs felt they could take business away from banks. But that has changed - Fintechs realise they need to become allies of financial institutions and financial institutions know they need the help of FinTechs to integrate advanced technologies into their legacy systems. Both sides realise collaboration is the best way forward to deliver the services customers need. FinTechs bring to the table processes and technologies that will change the way financial institutions deliver services. In working with FinTechs, we need to understand that failure sometimes has to be accepted, as does coming to a dead end in certain projects. Financial institutions need to move towards an environment in which they can build new products and services quickly with a minimum of cost. This requires funding, but it also requires a change in mindset. Typically, in the banking industry we like to study a solution from A-Z and be sure of the results before it is launched.Traditionally, financial institutions have not been very fast when developing new products and services. FinTechs are teaching us that solutions can be developed quickly, however and that we can integrate the best aspects of what they provide into our own systems. Societe Generale Securities Services, for example, reshaped its custody IT using agile methodologies, which meant we could get to market much more quickly with the new architecture. Part of the methodology is to ensure that the business and IT sides worked in close collaboration.FinTechs should no longer be seen as competitors, but as organisations that can help financial institutions to bring the best of technology to the table. There is no reason to reinvent the wheel.Some financial institutions have been acquiring FinTechs, which is a way of deep-diving into the technology. The key here is to ensure that you keep the people that work for the FinTech as a big part of the value of FinTechs resides in the minds of the people who work for them. However, it isn’t always necessary to buy a FinTech company, financial institutions can benefit just as much by working with them and adopting their solutions and methodologies.Some FinTechs positioned themselves as outliers and tried to occupy territories in the financial world that are borderline and do not come under a great deal of regulation. But they have come to learn that regulations are constantly changing and that changes in regulation can mean they have to come to the negotiation table and pay attention to the regulatory world. They have also realised that they require funding from financial institutions so taking a more conciliatory approach towards financial institutions, rather than stating they will take our business away from us, makes sense.It is likely that there will be some evolution of FinTech companies as their technology becomes embedded in financial institutions. Financial institutions will learn to create a new way of delivering services and will feel less threatened that FinTechs will steal their business away because there are other factors, particularly regulation, that will prevent this. Successful FinTech companies will be those that accept that rather than taking business away from banks their technologies will be adopted by banks. They will then focus on leading the development of technology for banks to integrate. FinTechs have had an impact on the way innovation is considered by financial institutions. The FinTechs rang alarm bells for banks, alerting us to the fact that innovation and research and development deliver results and are good things to do. Financial institutions are re-occupying this world, because they cannot let only FinTechs innovate in the banking world. It is not black and white, however; there is co-opetition, competition and collaboration taking place. This has led to a cross-fertilisation of ideas that is fostering much more innovation in the banking world. ",19110,2,518

In addition, they were tasked with helping young banking users to invest their money wisely and test whether introducing games into banking apps might also help engagement.One project came up with the idea of using an avatar (savings advisor) and pet (banking companion) to the app to demonstrate the value of savings and investments.

However, for this vision to be realised, more than just innovative technology is required: this technology must be embedded in a broader legal context and be sympathetic to the reality of business.”Earlier this year, Barclays Bank demonstrated a Smart Contract Templates prototype creating an Isda agreement and an interest rate swap trade that then executed as a smart contract on R3’s Corda platformLee Braine, investment bank CTO office at Barclays, welcomed the broader collaboration effort: “Barclays has been actively engaging in the blockchain field for two years, including experimenting with vendor products, supporting innovative startups via the Barclays Accelerator, and participating in industry consortia such as the R3 consortium and the Post-Trade Distributed Ledger Group.

	If you thought hot digital talent wouldn’t want to work for a bank, you’d be wrong. Just ask our hires from Ebay, Skype, Amazon, Asos and Disney. It’s also a myth that Millennials don’t want to work for banks either - we currently have 30 amazing digital grads who joined us last September when we launched the first digital graduate scheme in banking. And with £1billion invested in building digital capability across the bank over three year up to 2017 they know there is plenty for them to do. But that’s not to say it’s always easy to attract the best digital talent. With digital skills in short supply, the battle for the best talent is on, and of course it’s a challenge for a bank to compete with a celebrated tech giant or a Shoreditch start up. As the nature of skills we need in our business has changed, so too have the talent sources we look to, to attract the right people. We’re no longer competing just with our industry peers for talent, but tech companies and digital retailers. Gender diversity in the tech industry is also a challenge, as typically just 1 in 14 candidates for a tech job is female. So to achieve our talent and growth ambitions we needed to rethink our strategy. Our approach has three main elements: develop the right environment to attract and retain talented people; find a compelling way to amplify our employer brand in the market, and get our processes to select and onboard talent right every time.What surprises a lot of people who join the team or visit our digital hubs is that we don’t conform to what people imagine from a stereotypical bank. We have created an innovation movement that makes us more Google than Gringotts. Our digital hub in London sits equidistant to the traditional heart of banking in the City of London and the epicentre of digital Shoreditch, with more locations across the UK helping to shape our three retail brands; Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Halifax.Whilst we appreciate the importance of the physical environments our people work in - we thrive in bright open plan spaces (no grey compartmentalised offices here) with walls which you can write on so you never lose a good idea) - we know that it takes more than a few bean bags to create a culture.We have thought about the behaviours and operating principles that will guide our progress. We need great people to be great for our customers and that’s what is happening with our services - we have topped ranked mobile apps and have recently won the Best Online Provider Award from Business Moneyfacts.We run regular mash ups, hack days and innovation jams to innovate solutions for customers and challenge the way we do things. We hold weekly Digital Espressos (think live TedTalks) and monthly Espresso Martini evening meet ups for internal and external thought leaders to get together and share ideas. We partner with Fintech accelerators and start ups to incubate ideas, and use social collaboration tools (our monthly “Ask Me Anything” sessions with leaders are particularly popular), as well as frequent opportunities to bring people together for stand ups and events. We know we need to enable people to make a meaningful contribution at work, and our digital teams are actively changing the way Britain banks. More than 11,500 of our people across the group are “Digital Champions” helping business, charities and customers get the most out of being online and taking our digital capability across the bank and into our communities. We achieve consistently above average employee engagement scores, and good retention and internal promotion rates. And we are key supporters and influencers on the women in FinTech agenda. We have a number of senior female top talent who are acting as role models to inspire future tech talent inside and outside of our organisation. Our focus became how to stop being the best kept secret in FinTech and send an authentic and compelling message to our target talent.In theory, online platforms make it easier to find (and lose) talented people. In reality, talent is smart and our shop window needed to be in order. LinkedIn transformed the way talent connects with employers. This made the market more open, and authentic. Sites like Glassdoor make job to job comparisons available at a click, so a strong, differentiated and compelling brand is essential.We know that top digital talent are savvy individuals and we work hard to reach them with a compelling recruitment message. We developed a content-led approach, which enables us to tell the story of the things that we are doing to change the way Britain banks on our online hub. Using social media and encouraging organic advocacy of our people, we have been telling our story in the places that tech talent hang out online. But this is just the first step of the process. Building an intelligent selection approach, which codifies the critical success factors and mindset for success in role is key, so we developed a bespoke psychometric assessment to help us make the right decision every time. We also start the bonding and onboarding process with new colleagues earlier and do it more effectively.As we look forward, it’s clear that the world of work will change significantly in the next five to ten years as the paradigm around the construct of work evolves. Our focus now is looking to the future of work, and evolving our environment to anticipate and embrace it.

Following Swave’s achievement at the innovation challenge, Lloyds invited Bordas and Tappin to base themselves in the bank’s digital hub in London for 12 weeks, where they stand to benefit from input from the bank’s digital team as they build their proposition.
Tappin says: “Being able to base ourselves right in the centre of Lloyds’ innovation team means that we can appreciate first hand the considerations that we need to make to ensure what we’re offering not only offers a great user experience, but that we have the technical capabilities to scale our offering in line with demand.”
During the 12 weeks being spent with Lloyds, he says Swave intends to launch a pilot to test the app in advance of a full rollout early next year.
Marc Lien, Lloyds Banking Group’s director of innovation & digital development says: “We’re able to share with Krissy and Ross what we have learnt going through similar product and proposition development. In turn, we can understand the different considerations that they are able to make as an innovative start up, making this a great example of the mutual benefit for both banks and Fintechs that collaboration can bring.”

In theory Square, which applied for an ILC rather than a traditional banking license, will be able to continue to operate its food delivery business Caviar as well as the provision of its payment terminals.The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) noted in a protest letter to the FDIC that Square’s application is designed to avoid legal prohibitions and restrictions under the Bank Holding Company Act.“Square should be subject to the same restrictions and supervision that any other bank holding company of a community bank is subject to,” ICBA EVP and senior regulatory counsel Christopher Cole wrote. “Furthermore, Congress should close the ILC loophole because it not only threatens the financial system but creates an uneven playing field for community banks.”ILCs were subject to a moratorium during the passing of the Dodd Frank Act but this was lifted in 2014. Since then retailer WalMart unsuccessfully applied for an ILC, followed earlier this year online lending startup SoFi in a move which has also been opposed by the banking lobby.ICBA’s letter calls on Congress to permanently close the ILC loophole, arguing that the integration of massive technology and banking firms would result in ""an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets while posing significant conflicts of interest and privacy concerns"".In response, a Square spokesperson says: ""Our application reflects Square’s ability to build a bridge between the financial system and the underserved, addressing the needs of small businesses that few community banks even reach.

Since then retailer WalMart unsuccessfully applied for an ILC and then earlier this year online lending startup SoFi applied for an ILC. The application is still pending but if successful it would be the first award of an ILC for more than a decade.The move, first reported by American Banker, would also potentially pave the way for Square to assume banking status. According to a Square spokesperson, the new bank will offer loans to small businesses, similar to its lending service Square Capital which is a partnership with Celtic Bank, as well as some deposit services. ILC status would enable Square to continue lending but without the reliance on a banking partner such as Celtic Bank. According to Dorsey, Square has to date lent more than $1.8 billion to over 140,000 businesses, with an average loan size of $6,000.

The Nationwide Now project has so far reached around 60 branches, with more to come. Beale thinks that in the future customers will use the face-to-face video service from the comfort of their own homes via tablets and laptops. But in the meantime the technology is actually helping to keep branches alive because it is far more economically viable for remote branches with low demand than full-time mortgage consultants. This means that branches can justify their existence.""A lot of people say that the impact of digital is going to remove branches from the high street. We're forming an alternative view,"" says Beale.Nationwide says that 94% of customers who have used the video links think that the service is a good or excellent replacement for face-to-face meetings. Beale tells Finextra that the building society has made moves to make the system as personal as possible. For example, advisors ask customers if they want a cup of tea and then contact the in-branch team to get one delivered.""There's a very good way of melding very modern technology with all the benefits and cosiness of a branch environment,"" he argues.Nationwide CEO Graham Beale talks to Finextra at the BSA Annual Conference

	Launched three years ago with just £770,000 in angel funding, Edinburgh-based intelligentpos offers a cloud-based point of sale app for shops, bars and restaurants. The acquisition sees iZettle move deeper into the retail value chain, allowing small businesses to take card payments and track inventory, run loyalty programmes and analyse customer spending patterns. It also provides it with a new recurring revenue stream, based on a software-as-a-service model.Jacob de Geer, CEO and co-founder at iZettle says: “One year ago, iZettle broke new ground by offering small businesses hassle-free access to financing with iZettle Advance.

	SIX Payment Services (SIX), together with a number of partners, has been commissioned by the Swiss banks to develop a new multi-vendor software programme for the ATMs of the future. Following a successful pilot phase earlier this year, from 2018 onwards it is expected to be used in all ATMs across Switzerland. Financial centres around the world are currently facing a dilemma that will not be easy to resolve: the much-talked-about digitalisation is now well established. New technologies and market participants are coming into the financial arena and working hard, often successfully, to take a piece of the pie. As a result, old business models are being replaced, with the value chain for established banks and financial services providers permanently changed. This presents two risks: the first, falling behind the competition and failing to be fast and modern enough to remain relevant; the second, taking on a pioneering role in terms of offers and technologies, but operating inefficiently.Faced with these challenges, we have been strategically examining the possibility and feasibility of consolidating back-office functions into a central Swiss bank back office. The advantages and disadvantages of a central, consolidated back office could be discussed forever and there are many ways of bundling services. A trend towards increased outsourcing of services beyond a firm’s core business to experts continues unabated, with many banks choosing to outsource a part of their value chain.This is where project ATMfutura comes in. Today, there are 26 individual solutions in use in the Swiss market, from four different manufacturers. Implementing a standard increases reliability and saves costs in a business area in which banks are unable to differentiate themselves. The focus for ATMfutura is on the elimination of inefficient parallel structures and standardisation. SIX has taken the lead for the Swiss banking community and is working with all banks to consolidate the different ATM software systems into one system which runs on all current devices. Following a successful pilot, major Swiss bank UBS will soon join Credit Suisse in introducing the common software standard to its devices. Other banks are set to follow, creating the necessary conditions for the central management of ATMs in Switzerland.The multivendor software is the first step in the ATMfutura project. The software runs on all Swiss ATMs, irrespective of their origin or manufacture, eliminating the need for banks to replace their ATMs. Looking forward, ATMfutura will also relieve the banks of the burden of monitoring and managing their ATM networks and fulfill the necessary conditions for taking over other elements in the value chain. This may include evaluating locations, installation, equipping or disposing of the ATMs. This package of standardisation volume bundling and process optimisation will save the banks money, whilst ensuring they keep up to date with the latest developments in ATM software. With the switch to ATMfutura, new interbank solutions will be available across Switzerland. The standardisation of software means all users will experience the same interface and the same user guidance on all ATMs in Switzerland in the future - substantially simplifying their operations. New functions will be possible and enabled across the entire ATM network too. These include free selection of accounts when making cash withdrawals; the talking ATM, for the visually impaired; and offering a choice of bank note denominations to be dispensed.Cash withdrawals and deposits at ATMs can also be carried out using a QR code, using a smartphone, for example. This function offers both customers and banks numerous benefits:•	The average duration of each ATM transaction is considerably reduced. Consequently, the amount of customers who can be serviced in a set time will increase, resulting in smaller queues at highly frequented locations.•	The generated QR code significantly increases the level of convenience for bank customers, as cash withdrawals can be prepared ahead of time through the mobile banking app and made quickly and easily at ATMs.•	The generated QR code can be forwarded to any smartphone, allowing the recipient to withdraw cash from any ATM.We are also examining modular business process outsourcing solutions whereby services from various partners are bundled into an efficient package along the entire value chain. Possible services include support when evaluating locations and installation of devices, through to the full operation of hardware and software including general maintenance and cash re-stocking. In this way, banks are benefitting from significant cost savings, thanks to standardisation, volume bundling and process optimisation.There is already huge demand for these central offerings and we expect this trend to continue with applications suitable to international financial centres. The low interest rate environment, low margins and increasing regulation is an opportunity, not just for the success of this project, but for the entire banking industry.

  });
I had the privilege to attend the Money20/20 event in Singapore this week. I had been asked to give a keynote address on behalf of BBVA and chose a topic that was both provocative and yet also important to the future of the industry. The topic was “Can banks be a threat to big tech?”It stems from a reaction my colleagues at BBVA and I have been experiencing for a long time, which is that too often the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are said to be the only ones truly serving customer needs.I remember being at a similar conference in Madrid last year, where the founder of a unicorn – a start-up business that has achieved billion-dollar value – stood up and said the main reason he had started his business was because banks were failing society.And he’s not alone. Time and again we hear in the press that Big Tech is going to erode the value of banking, that it’s only Big Tech that innovates for people, that Big Tech will eat the banks alive.This annoys me and those I work with at BBVA, because we honestly think it’s nonsense. I’m not saying the banking system is perfect – we are all aware of the implications of 2008 and the impact that has had on people’s lives. And banking and those that work in the sector have had to rightfully work hard at changing a broken system.But let’s also look at some facts: Banking supports more than 18m jobs globally. Extrapolate that out to the average family size, add in the wider family members, and banking supports the livelihoods of more than 100m people around the world.Even more so, people trust banks with some $52tr dollars each year to save for things that matter to them, to build savings, to fund their children’s education or give themselves a bit of security.Banks also do what they have been doing for centuries, which is helping the growth of societies by lending – last year providing more than $66tr to people wanting to start, grow, or consolidate businesses around the world.However, it is right that the sector faces a challenge from the Big Tech players, and I’ll explain where and how that challenge manifests itself a bit later, but the three key things I talked about this week were these: NTS, Trust and i2o.Needs, time and stressLet’s start with NTS. It stands for Needs, Time and Stress. These elements are critical to understanding how banks and big tech are aiming to help people.The Chilean economist Manfred Max Neef outlines nine basic needs that people face – affection, freedom, participation, creation, identity, leisure, protection, subsistence and understanding. Many of these needs to some extent are directly met by money, and money’s ubiquity naturally plays some part in the others.When it comes to time, studies show that roughly speaking the average person’s day can be divided into three lots of 8 hours – eight to work, eight to sleep and eight hours when people are managing their lives, eating, taking part in leisure activities and so on. Recent estimates suggest around 1.5 hours a day is spent on social media – which reminds me of the claim that Netflix says its biggest competitor is sleep!Lastly, stress. Here a study by GfK of 27.000 people in 22 countries showed that for most people money was the biggest cause of stress in their lives.I give this background because these three elements make up the backbone of where big tech and banking are starting to encroach on each other’s’ traditional areas of work – the blurring of industry lines.Interactions to oportunitiesFor forward thinking digital banks like BBVA the future lies in taking the blurring of these lines and using it to our advantage by playing to our strengths around the core theme of i2o – Interactions to Opportunities.The reason big tech wants to start offering some banking services is because at the moment its model is one of high frequency of interactions, with a high volume of data created, but with relatively low value to it.Banking on the other hand creates low frequency, low volume, but high value data sets. We can sum this up in the following statistic: 2000 Versus 200 or 10 to 1.Big Tech gets on average 2000 interactions per customer per year – but someone liking a post on Facebook or searching for a lawnmower on Google is relatively low value data – you can’t monetize it very much.Banking, on the other hand, gets far fewer customer interactions – but they are typically higher value – both monetarily and emotionally.However, what both sectors are really trying to do is increase the volume of data they have from customers, so they can help them do more, know more, make better decisions – and in the process derive their own value from it.Circle of trustHere though is where banking differs greatly from Big Tech, and it’s something our CEO Carlos Torres Vila has outlined brilliantly. The difference comes down to a circle of trust – who do you trust to manage your data and money best – and we are starting to see across the media a backlash against the way big tech monetizes your data for their profitability, without sharing the true value with you. Equally, criticism of the ways in which they fail to keep that data secure and safe, providing a channel for misinformation.More than that, though, the circle of trust is about earning the right to do more with that data. If you trust us with some of your spending data, and we save you time, help you meet your needs, and reduce your stress – then you will trust us with more data and the cycle continues. We can help you do more with your data and money – which are effectively interchangeable these days – and you will let us do more for you.If customers trust us with their data, we will be able to help them meet their needs, and reduce their stress.There is one further, critical element though. Banks needs to operate in ways that work best for their customers and clients – that use the digital platforms they want to use, that have the levels of user experience that big tech has championed, that are intuitive, adaptable, safe.So, this is what banks like BBVA have been doing – and was part of the impetus for the digital transformation that our Chairman instigated with such foresight more than a decade ago.Yet, we also know we can’t do it alone – which is why we work hard to build a wider ecosystem of partners, third parties, fintech start-ups and indeed innovation builders from within the bank – as this graphic shows.BBVA’s innovation ecosystem.It comes down to i2o – and building ways to have smarter interactions with our customers and clients. This video gives just a brief glimpse into three products that are now live at BBVA – all designed to help with the NTS requirements customers have, to weave in third party data or products, and most importantly to knit together data and money in ways that offer real solutions, real insights, real actionable opportunities.At BBVA we know that if we use people’s data in a cleverer way, we can make things better. For us, that’s an interaction. Here’s three examples of just how we are doing that.So, coming back to the original argument – can banks be a threat to big tech? The answer is we have to be.Again, Executive Chairman Francisco González, has highlighted how the banking sector will contract from 20,000 banks today to thousands to perhaps dozens in the future. Only those banks that adapt to customer needs and become digital companies themselves will survive – like BBVA.So, it’s not that we want to be a threat to Google by starting a search engine or to Facebook by setting up a social media site. It’s that our evolution – and banks have always been good at that – means that we need to move into the blur and expand our products and services, utilize new technologies, while all the while working to improve the lives of our customers and clients. And that transition means we will need to play into the areas where big tech wants to grow – that, then, is the threat.Who will win – well, ultimately, and rightly, it will come down to those that use what we provide. In other words, the people will decide.

	Two PE firms Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners have bid £2.9bn to acquire US-based payment processor Paysafe. Meanwhile, London-based Permira has bought a 10% stake in Swedish payments startup Klarna at a cost of £250m.
These deals come the day after French payment provider Ingenico acquired another Swedish payments firm Bambora for £1.5bn.
Many more deals have been announced in the last month, including a £7.7bn bid for UK-based Worldpay from US credit card processor Vantiv as well as reported bids for Danish payment provider Nets.
Paysafe had initially been approached by a consortium back in May. Since then it has seen its share price rise from 450p per share to 582p and the Blackstone/CVC bid values each share at 590p, a premium of 30% based on its May share price and a reflection of just how highly rated the sector currently is by investors.
The bid has the support of Paysafe's largest current shareholder Old Mutual Global Investors and Blackstone and CVC have until August 18th to make a formal bid.
The deal for Klarna comes after the Swedish startup was awarded a banking license by the Swedish financial authorities in June. 
The appetite for all things payments-related has been attributed to the growing trend for consumers to eschew cash as a means of payment in favour of their smartphones and other mobile devices. 
The current spate of deals was arguably started back last year when MasterCard acquired UK-based Vocalink for £700m.

Nets chief executive Bo Nilsson said earlier this month that Nets is seeing ""considerable interest"" from potential buyers, including other payment processing players as well as private equity groups.

	Billed as a session on the Internet of Things (IoT) and core banking systems the discussion at the Marina Bay Sands convention centre in Singapore ranged across a variety of topics, illustrating the diverse skills and experiences needed to direct information technology in a large, modern financial institution.Chief technologists from UBS, ANZ and Standard Chartered shared their perspectives on how banks take and apply technology to the conflicting challenges of operational efficiency and business transformation.Oliver Bussman, the CIO at UBS and formerly CIO at technology firm SAP, identified trade finance as an immediate target to be reinvented by the Internet of Things.“Trade Finance is ripe for reinvention,"" he told the audience. ""It is very complicated, very time and paper intensive. When the movement of physical goods can be linked it can be simplified massively going forwards. It is an area ready to be disrupted.”“Customer experience is important in wholesale too,” said Patrick Maes, CTO at ANZ. “Corporate treasurers want to transact from the golf course too, so the same issues apply as they do with consumer services.”The CIOs were prompted to explain how they manage in the current environment, with fintech insurgents gathering both confidence and capital. “Disruption is simply change at high speed,” commented Maes. “Don’t look to the current players to predict the future. Remember we are closer now to 2030, than we are to 2000.”Michael Gorriz, group CIO, Standard Chartered, questioned whether some popular orthodoxies - such as ‘fail fast’ - transferred well to the banking environment: “A fintech startup is usually a couple of founders with a crazy idea who are happy to take a risk. And let’s not forget, eighty five percent of startups fail. That doesn’t transfer well to the expected career structure within a bank. We don’t reward people who fail.”Patrick Maes echoed the recent statements from the chairman of BBVA, Francisco Gonzalez, that the future model for a bank will be closer to that of a software business. All three, whether deliberately or subconsciously, used the language of the software industry to describe their own businesses, referring to the need to use APIs for agility and to build out protective ecosystems of partners and suppliers.When asked about suppliers, Michael Gorriz, himself from a career in the automotive industry, used that business model as an example to illustrate how banks needed to rely upon key suppliers in much the same way as car manufacturers depend upon a supply chain of specialists. “I’m looking for partners with capabilities I don’t have,"" he said. ""Specialisation is the key to selection.”

	In a statement, City Union Bank says that it found the three fraudulent transactions during its reconciliation process on 7 February.The previous day, the hackers had managed to disconnect the City printer connected to Swift, meaning that the bank did not receive acknowledgement messages for the transactions.One of the payments, a $500,000 transfer made through Standard Chartered Bank, New York to a Dubai-based bank was blocked immediately and the funds returned to City. Another, for EUR300,000 made through Standard Chartered Bank, Frankfurt to a Turkey-based bank has been blocked in the beneficiary's account. The third payment, for $1 million was made through BofA to a China-based bank and has already been claimed by someone submitting forged documents.In an interview, City Union Bank CEO N Kamakodi told Reuters that there are similarities with the Bangladesh Bank hack, which saw crooks use malware to disable the Swift printer before stealing $81 million.In contrast, the bank has been keen to stress that, contrary to some early reports, there is no evidence of its staff being involved in the crime.Speculation about an inside job bubbled because of a scandal that has emerged in recent days at a Mumbai branch of Punjab National Bank, where a manager is accused of a six-year operation that saw $1.8 billion in fraudulent transactions made.The manager and a subordinate have been arrested, accused of colluding with, among others, a billionaire jeweller called Nirav Modi. According to court documents reviewed by Reuters, branch deputy manager Gokulnath Shetty issued a series of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking to other banks so that they would provide loans to a group of Indian jewellery companies.He did this using the bank’s Swift system to log in with passwords that allowed him to not only send the messages but also review them for approval. He then failed to record the transactions on the bank's internal system - something required because the software was not linked to Swift.News of the Union Bank heist comes just days after reports that a Russian bank last year lost $6 million to cybercrooks in an attack that took advantage of internal security weaknesses in the bank's gateway to Swift.

	First unveiled in November, Project Ubin is a MAS-led initiative to see how DLT can be used for the clearing and settlement of payments and securities, specifically the use of a tokenised form of the Singapore dollar on a distributed ledger.The work builds on a similar Bank of Canada-led and R3-backed effort, called Project Jasper, which used a digital currency to enable interbank payments.The Singapore central bank says the three software models developed in Phase 2 of Project Ubin are amongst the first in the world to implement decentralised netting of payments in a manner that preserves transactional privacy. Existing netting programmes used in inter-bank payments rely on a single payment queue visible to the operator to find offsetting payments. Decentralising the queue, however, potentially exposes payment details to an unauthorised party. ""The latest models in Project Ubin achieve a superior combination of decentralisation and privacy,"" says MAS.Accenture, which was appointed to manage and develop the prototypes, intends to publish a report on the outcomes in November.Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer, MAS, says: “A key outcome of the consortium’s effort is the ability to perform netting while protecting the privacy of transactions. This helps to open up opportunity for a wider adoption of DLT-based settlement systems.

A streamlining of the regulatory rulebook is similarly on the agenda under an initiative dubbed ""Banking Made Easy"". ""We will set up a new task force within the HKMA and work with the banking industry to identify and, where appropriate, modify or streamline those regulatory requirements or processes that may hinder technological innovations,"" said Chan.

	A pilot has been run in the first quarter of this year with two Singaporean banks to expand the MyInfo service to the financial industry for more efficient KYC using trusted, government-collected personal data.
MyInfo is a personal data platform, containing government-verified personal details such as the national ID number and residential address. It enables residents to provide their personal data just once to the government, and retrieve their personal details for all subsequent online transactions with the government.
“Before you go to full e-KYC, you need to figure out a national strategy for digital identity,” says Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief Fintech Officer of Monetary Authority of Singapore at FinTechStage in Jakarta, Indonesia. “That’s the core, the engine. And you can build the KYC digital attributes around it, and then the distribution of the data in a safe and secure way.”
Because KYC and identity authentication are involved in so many financial services processes, from opening a bank account to making a payment to making an insurance claim, Mohanty says it is a problem worth solving.
MAS has partnered with the Ministry of Finance and GovTech to conduct the pilot with the two banks, but Mohanty says there will be further evolution of the project after the first phase is rolled out across the Singapore banking sector.
“We’re currently looking at refinement of the model, the golden source of data, and the working of the government agencies. We will complete the pilot in the coming months. Then once the APIs and golden source are available, others can come in and use this utility for basic KYC,” he says.
“There is also some discussion around what we call KYC++, including things such as nuanced inference of data. And this is where we need some industry expertise and input, but that’s a staged discussion”

Other incidents involved distributed denial-of-service attacks, accompanied by threats of extortion.Key proposed requirements include two-factor authentication, for clients’ system login and prompt notification to clients of unusual activities in their internet trading accounts.In addition, the SFC proposes to expand the scope of cybersecurity-related regulatory principles to cover the trading of securities which are not listed or traded on an exchange and to update the definition of 'internet-trading' to include mobile phones. “Hacking of internet trading accounts is the most serious cybersecurity risk faced by internet brokers in Hong Kong,” says Ashley Alder, the SFC’s chief executive officer. “Brokers must strengthen their resilience to hacking and other cybersecurity risks by adopting robust preventive and detective controls.”

	The two month trial, which finished in February, was designed to see if using distributed ledger technology could slash the current three day time period for carrying out cross-border securities transactions.Mizuho says that the current complex system, which involves a great deal of time spent checking the settlement instructions and transaction content for inconsistencies, leaves asset managers at risk of things such as counterparty bankruptcy.While the use of centralised management has the potential to shorten settlement periods, Mizuho argues that the high costs involved make it ""impractical"".The bank therefore teamed up with Fujitsu on its trial in the hope of building a blockchain-based system that can almost instantly share matched trade information in the post-trade process as data that cannot be tampered with, but without building a large-scale settlement system from scratch. The partners built a blockchain-forming system in Fujitsu’s cloud environment, recording all the information from a confirmation as one linked block.

In a process facilitated by Swift, for decades banks have made correspondent relationships with partners in other countries to access their local payment systems and currencies in order to carry out cross-border transactions.
But because the system relies on a bank opening a local currency, Nostro, account with the foreign provider, there ends up being two separately held versions of the account statement that need to be maintained and reconciled.
ANZ and Wells Fargo say that this leads to poor payment transparency, onerous reconciliation activities and investigations, delays in advising of fund disbursement, and inefficiencies in management and usage of liquidity and funding.
The pair argue that blockchain can help address these problems by creating a single record of account that can be shared and maintained by lots of correspondent banks.
The two banks have delivered a proof of concept, creating a shared distributed ledger platform they say demonstrates the potential to improve the efficiency and speed of cross-border correspondent banking payment reconciliation and settlement, while operating in parallel with existing infrastructure.

Nigel Dobson, GM, wholesale digital and transformation projects, ANZ, says: ""The success of our proof of concept highlights what can be achieved when technology and business innovation are combined with cross-industry collaboration."" 
Dobson hopes the results will form the basis of further discussions and knowledge-sharing across the industry.
""While this joint initiative has advanced our collective thinking on innovations in this space, the networked nature of both this problem and the proposed DLT solution means the full benefits will only be realised through broad industry participation and adoption,"" he says.

For the latter, the protocol will be adopted by its treasury arm for conducting instantaneous international money transfers. On the banking side, Ripple has so far snared deals with two small US banks and Fidor Bank in Germany.

	It may still take up to 10 years for the blockchain tipping point to arrive, but participants across the financial services landscape are focused on deriving tangible value from their investment of time and money into blockchain experimentation in the very near term. This is among the key findings of a new paper produced by Finextra in association with EPAM.
Based on in-depth interviews with a wide range of market participants from banks, market infrastructures and key technology vendors, the paper explores the increased urgency with which the industry is seeking to press home the advantages blockchain could bring across a range of activities, including securities, payments and trade.
Entitled 'From hype to reality: Developing a pragmatic approach to blockchain in financial services', the paper identifies a number of developments in recent months which show the industry is taking a more measured approach to blockchain, while also looking to shorten the time to value from this innovation. Key among these is a growing emphasis on adoption by market infrastructures as the route to tackling the network effect challenge and achieving mainstream adoption quickly and efficiently.
Clearly the dust has not completely settled around blockchain: its exact sweet spots for implementation, the standard fabric that will end up dominating and just exactly how to handle the task of changing the wheels on a moving vehicle and going live on day one with this new infrastructure for markets in flight are all questions that still need to be answered.
As Balazs Fejes, Co-Head Global Business, EPAM, says: “There are still plenty of predictions about the kind of impact blockchain will have – whether it will be the new internet, whether it will be as disruptive as electronic trading, whether Bitcoin, far from being old hat is actually still integral to the future of blockchain – and the excitements, debates, disagreements and discussions are important as part of the process of reaching clarity and zeroing in on the most significant opportunities for this technology.”
He adds: “The good news is that, in the background, genuine progress is being made towards capitalising on those opportunities in the real world.”
Indeed, the new paper reflects a marketplace taking a much calmer approach to this innovation, understanding that some questions will only be answered over time – but recognising that that does not mean progress cannot be made in the interim. This is good news, given the problems the industry needs to solve, as one observer quoted in the paper points out: “There are so many problems, and blockchain can help us with many of them: providing invaluable elements like immutable record, permissioned access and a golden source of data.”
Through sections exploring how blockchain has matured during 2016, the areas of financial services in which it is most applicable, the ways in which it might go mainstream and the roadblocks that could still send it off course, the new paper seeks to offer insights to financial institutions grappling with what the technology means for their business, concluding with some insights on what a pragmatic approach to blockchain might look like.

	Apple Pay was launched in Australia in November 2015 through a limited partnership with American Express but was met with resistance from local banks because they are prevented from accessing Apple's near field communication (NFC) technology, which enables tap and go payments.Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac and Bendingo, have applied to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for permission to negotiate collectively with Apple over NFC access and to challenge what they see as anti-competitive behaviour.The banks would like to offer their own digital wallet services via Apple's iPhones but instead have to either work around the restriction, by placing a tap-and-go sticker on the back of the phones, or else sign up to Apple Pay and share any revenue with the technology giant.In its submission to the ACCC, Apple accuses the banks of acting as a cartel to undermine competition in the local payments market.""The request by the applicant banks would slow innovation and reduce choice by protecting members of the cartel from competition with each other,"" states the letter.Apple further claims that opening up its proprietary hardware and software to banks would constitute a security risk: ""Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices.”Apple notes that the banks account for a 66% market share in credit cards, adding: ""Given their scale and market share, the applicants are essential to Apple's ability to offer Apple Pay on a meaningful basis within Australia.""

	Banks' initial responses to fast-moving developments in digital currency - appointing mid-level technology executives to industry consortia, participating in the conference circuit and running limited distributed ledger simulations - have left them flat-footed, claims the consultancy.Lack of a clear path forward is particularly problematic for international payments and trade finance, where distributed ledgers have the greatest near-term potential for disruption.Blockchain-based alternatives to the global correspondent banking model for processing cross-border transactions are already gaining credence, presenting opportunities to cut out the middle man, improve visibility and reduce error rates and costs. In trade finance, which generates roughly $23 billion of direct banking revenues worldwide, similar forces are work. About 50% of banks' costs for a letter of credit arises from manual document handling and checking, which creates delays, errors and expense. That opens the door to huge potential improvements from distributed ledgers, says Bain, though commercial offerings capitalising on that possibility are still in early stages.David Gunn, head of Bain's payments team in Emea, comments. ""The wave of investment in digital currency start-ups clearly signals that payments channels are attracting a new degree of interest, and new competitors are changing customer expectations. Innovation is upon us, and doing nothing is not a viable option. Now is the time for banks to move from experimentation to action.""However, most financial institutions remain in 'experimentation mode', he says, wary about the scalability of the technology, privacy issues associated with broadcasting commercially sensitive information about money flows, and the volatility and governance of non-fiat digital currencies. With such a large prize available, faster-moving, more committed banks stand to gain significant share, says Glen Williams, who leads Bain's global payments sector. He says that interviews conducted with more than 50 senior bankers, venture capitalists, technologists, international payment association executives and start-up CEOs, convinced the firm that most banks are not well prepared for the forthcoming revolution. Regulatory hurdles are currently keeping the barbarians at the gates, but they also provide a comfort blanket for more conservative banks.""Change will not come easily for banks,"" says Williams. ""They recognise that distributed ledger technology has the potential to improve the speed, transparency and efficiency with which payments are made, but the current market structure gives them a powerful incentive to stay the course. About $300 trillion of transactions flow through these networks each year, creating significant revenues for banks. Further, network dynamics make it hard for alternatives to scale up: participants will not join a network until it has sufficient reach, but reach comes only from widespread participation.""

	Cobalt DL is primed for launch in 2017 with 15 leading institutional FX participants already committed to the service. The collaboration will see Cobalt DL creating a single, shared view of each FX transaction using SETL’s OpenCSD Platform. The immutable record is expected to reduce cost, complexity and inefficiency in the current FX post trade space, where a single trade creates multiple records for all parties, including buyers, sellers, brokers and clearers.The record will provide cryptographic proof of a contract and of the parties’ agreement to the trade terms. Participants will be able to retrieve details of their own trading activity from the ledger, while other participants’ data is screened off from general view.Andy Coyne, co-founder of Cobalt DL says: “The FX market requires systems to be able to achieve high burst transaction throughputs per second with daily capacity in the millions. SETL were able to demonstrate resilient working technology comfortably processing at both high burst and steady state speeds and in excess of 1.4 billion transactions a day - an absolute necessity in the high volume FX market.

	While US enrolment in loyalty programmes has grown at an impressive rate over the last few years, Deloitte argues that these programmes are not realising their potential thanks to account inactivity, low redemption rates, poor client retention and high transaction and system management costs. The central reason for these problems is the paucity of uniform management systems across programmes, which confuses customers, resulting in a lack of activity.The report says that trustless distributed ledger could address this by enabling loyalty reward programme providers, administrators, system managers and customers to intersect and interact in one system without intermediaries and without compromising privacy or competitiveness.In addition, providers would benefit from streamlined execution and administration of their programmes with near-real-time transparency, resulting in cost savings in the medium term.Finally, says Deloitte, blockchain can be deployed through social media and digital wallets, and can interact with existing loyalty rewards platforms through smart contracts and associated digital architecture.While lauding DLT's potential, Deloitte says that for it to transform the loyalty market at least a handful of players with well-developed programmes need to buy into the technology.""A best-case scenario is that a blockchain facilitator builds a network on a solid blockchain protocol and gets enough critical mass buy-in to develop standards for blockchain in the loyalty rewards space in general.""Read the paper: » Download the document now 2.3 mb (PDF File)

""A group of participants can now permission a working blockchain platform in a matter of minutes and jointly record and settle changes in ownership. This will help bring competition into a segment of financial markets which has thus far been dominated by quasi-monopolistic incumbents.”Enabling the interaction of different participants, including custodians, registrars and payment institutions, OpenCSD comprises a permissioned membership structure, and control functions across clearing, settlement and corporate actions. Liquidity functionality, including collateral and repo facilities, is also included, alongside a secure messaging system for transmitting ISO messages and bespoke communications between participants.

It is a means for market participants to empower themselves and to design services around their own needs and cost expectations. ”He says the subscription-based service will initially be made available to a limited number of subscribers for the first phase of the roll-out. In addition, SETL will establish a development partner programme to engage with fintech shops to design and build around the platform.The firm in April struck a deal with Computershare to apply the technology to the Australian markets, bringing together issuers, asset owners, brokers, regulators and market infrastructure providers.

Opening hours will be 8.00am to 8.00pm from Monday to Friday. There will be a 15-minute turnaround time for approved account applications over-the-counter and branch services will be backed up by online services and a 24/7, London-based, call centre.In addition, branches will give a ""friendly welcome to dogs and their owners"" complete with water bowls and dog biscuits.The bank is co-founded by Anthony Thomson and Vernon Hill, the US entrepreneur who established Commerce Bank, on which the new venture is based, in the 1970s. This week the Reuben brothers acquired a five per cent stake in the firm.""Our focus will always be the customers, both retail and business, and making sure we do the right thing by them. The British public deserves a better banking experience, and Metro Bank intends to give it to them, where, when and however they choose,"" says Hill.

	The watchdog has launched a new programme, dubbed Project Innovate, with the aim of ensuring that positive developments in areas such as mobile banking, online investment or money transfer, are supported by the regulatory environment.Outlining the approach at a conference hosted by Bloomberg on Thursday, FCA chief Martin Wheatley, pointed to the booming tech scene in London and the emergence of firms such as WorldRemit, Monitise, TransferWise, Nutmeg as evidence of a new wave of innovation in financial services""What has become increasingly obvious, as the dust settles on this latest wave of progress, is that it's an imperative for regulators to be standing on the right side of progress,"" he says. ""We want an FCA that creates room for the brightest and most innovative companies to enter the sector. The possibilities opening up for consumers are extraordinary - and it's clearly important they can be developed in the UK.""To help this happen, he says, the FCA is opening its doors to financial service firms who are developing innovative approaches that aren't explicitly addressed by current regulation - or where the guidance may be ambivalent. This engagement has already begun with a number of start-ups, as well as organisations like Tech City UK and Level 39, coming in to talk to FCA policy teams.The next step entails the creation of a scoping document exploring how innovation can be supported more effectively, focusing on the FCA's expectations of firms, as well as specifics around advice and support for businesses bringing new models of financial service to market.In the meantime, the watchdog intends to open up a dedicated 'hub' in its policy team which will pull together FCA expertise to support the innovation ecosystem.It will achieve this in two ways, say Wheatley: ""First, by providing help to firms who are developing new models or products advice on compliance so they can navigate the regulatory system. Second, by looking for areas where the system itself needs to adapt to new technology or broader change - rather than the other way round.""On top of this, he says, the regulator will also be launching ""an incubator to support innovative, small financial businesses as they ready themselves for regulatory authorisation"".The FCA's initiative comes as the UK Government re-affirmed its committment to breaking down barriers to entry for firms using innovative products and technology to challenge the established banking industry. This includes encouragement of peer-to-peer lending, opening up access to SME data and commissioning a feasibility study into the use of APIs for providing third party access to bank data. HM Treasury says it also intends to address concerns about the application of the Money Laundering Regulations by banks, and in particular their use in denying access to banking services by firms trading in virtual currencies. To this end it convened a Private Sector Consultative Forum in March with banks, firms, regulators and FATF member governments to ""enable a better understanding (of) the risks from virtual currencies and how these might be mitigated, including by banks"".

	The proposals, unveiled in today's budget statement, follow an idea first floated by coalition politician Vince Cable in a speech to the London Stock Exchange last month. At the time, he said that he was exploring an independent ""referrals exchange"" process so that small companies turned down for funding by a bank would be automatically referred to other providers. He said that current process was not working: ""If a bank turns down a business for a loan, in 40% of cases that business gives up.""Last week, seven of the country's major alternative funders launched a Web portal - alternativebusinessfunding.co.uk - designed to signpost SMEs to the most appropriate source of non-bank funding, providing a short-cut to alternative finance options.Collectively, the platforms behind the initiative - CrowdCube, Funding Circle, Market Invoice, Platform Black, Seedrs, Zopa and Pensionledfunding.com - account for 85% of the alternative non-bank funding market and have provided to date more than £580m to SMEs.Liberum, the investment bank, forecasts that alternative funding providers could originate £535bn in financing by 2024, which would represent 50% of the gross volumes in the UK and US consumer and UK SME market.Adam Tavener, chairman of pensionledfunding.com says: ""This is a real opportunity for a collaborative culture to develop between the banking and alternative sectors, not just to refer businesses but to work together on multi source deals that provide exactly the right shape of funding package for the business owner. Better signposting, would give businesses - particularly SMEs - safe access to approved lenders, while helping banks keep UK businesses growing by encouraging innovative or complimentary funding.""

	P2P lending (dubbed loan-based crowdfunding by the FCA) has seen its popularity soar over the last year, with £480 million lent to consumers and business through platforms such as Zopa and Funding Circle in 2013.
With the FCA taking on regulatory oversight of the practice from April, it has now, following consultation, set out rules designed to ensure that potential lenders have access to clear information on the risks that they are taking on and on who is ultimately borrowing their money.
The rules also require P2P platforms to put in place plans to make sure that loan repayments can still be made even if they get into difficulties. New prudential regulations will be introduced ""over time"" so that these firms have capital to help withstand financial shocks, an important feature because lenders will not be able to claim through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
The UK security-based crowdfunding market is far smaller than P2P, raising just £28 million last year but this represented a 600% rise on 2012 and the government is keen to promote takeup as an alternative to traditional high street lending.
To protect amateurs, normal investors will only be able to put up to 10% of their assets into crowdfunding projects. Those who take advice or are experienced  investors can put in more.
Christopher Woolard, director of policy, risk and research, FCA, says: ""We want to ensure that consumers are appropriately protected - but not prevented from investing. We have been careful to listen to feedback from the market and the rules provide consumer protection, whilst allowing businesses to continue to have access to this innovative method of funding.""
With many small firms still struggling to get financing from traditional sources, the government is keen to promote crowdfunding and P2P lending as viable alternatives.
However, Barry James, founder of The Crowdfunding Centre, slammed the rules, particularly the 10% provision: ""On a day like today one has to wonder whether our FCA is the worst regulator in the western world. The words that spring first to mind are inflexible, stubborn and unimaginative. Maybe it's time for a change.""

Phillips said the report will ""explore the implications of federal charters"" to promote ""effective regulation of growing fintech firms"" and the idea of regulators setting up their own innovation offices, something which the OCC and others have already done.
The report will include credit services, lending, digital financial planning and wealth management within its scope.

	When Bank of Ireland put open banking at the heart of its growth strategy, we knew that co-operation and innovation would be the keys to success. This meant working closely with fintechs to make us more competitive, and embracing the wider community of technology companies that might provide innovative, value-added solutions for our customers.We decided to create an ecosystem that was as open as possible and that would allow us to work with lots of different tech partners - from start-ups, through scale-ups to well-established companies. Our ecosystem is a truly symbiotic system that benefits everyone and, most importantly, our customers.But that's not all. Our ecosystem is global; we don't just work in Ireland. Our global footprint enables domestic tech firms that we work with to move more quickly on to a global stage. And when those tech companies are focused on banking, we get early access to the solution.So how do we do it?Our multi-faceted strategy has something for everyone. We work with students, undergraduates and post-graduates providing mentoring, funding and networking to connect them with entrepreneurs.For those thinking about entrepreneurship or building something special we have free drop-in, co-working spaces and trained staff to help with developing business ideas and finding support and funding. First established in 2015, we now have Workbenches in six branches, with more to come. They are open to all and foster an atmosphere of discussion and knowledge sharing.Their success has been phenomenal. The original Workbench, in our Grand Canal Street branch, Dublin, held more than 300 events in its first year, attended by more than 14,000 people. But it's not just about numbers; it's about bringing exciting new tech solutions to fruition. Plynk, a social-media payments app, is a product of Grand Canal Street Workbench. Its founders met there, came up with the concept for the business, worked with our community managers, received early-stage funding from our Delta Early Stage Capital fund, and were incubated in our Dublin offices. It has just closed a €25m fundraising round and announced 40 new jobs for Ireland.Where Workbench is open to all, StartLab is by invitation only. Once young tech companies have a proof of concept, they can apply to receive six months' free mentoring, support and work space to scale up their business. StartLab is focused on helping tech entrepreneurs understand the fundamentals of a business, including market and customer validation, product fit, pitching for funding and pitching for customers.Again, its success has been staggering. So much so that in March 2017 we opened a sister StartLab in New York to help Irish tech companies break into the US market. This program lasts 12 months (rather than six) and is free. Currently, it is helping seven Irish tech companies from premises near Grand Central Station, all of whom have received tremendous support from established Irish/American businesses.Our open business ecosystem is growing, and going global, and all this is helping to create a virtuous circle. The bigger and more dynamic the ecosystem, the better the environment for growth. For this reason we don't rule out candidates already supported by our rivals, and we are willing to look at any tech solution that can be applied to business.There is one exception to this. Where Workbenches, StartLabs and student programs have a general all entrepreneur remit, our forthcoming Dublin StartLab will heavily focus on fintech. Our Dublin StartLab will also leverage and partner with the Temenos' MarketPlace and Sandbox; which is focused on offering customers proven solutions that can be implemented quickly (MarketPlace) and understanding risk and protecting customers from it (Sandbox). Both of Temenos' initiatives allow companies to move faster with lesser risk, which has got to be good for everyone.We expect this fintech focus to provide insights into banking business models, show where fintech is heading, and help us make sure that the tech solutions we are promoting will solve real customer problems.Like all healthy ecosystems, ours is changing all the time.

However we don’t believe that is the correct strategy. ""When we look at trends within an area and find a drop in counter activity, we reinvent the space within the branch. Sometimes that means moving staff onto the floor instead of behind a counter, providing support with devices and advice on mortgages, investments, and insurance. ""This has already worked successfully for us in many of our branches, where we have actually seen an increase in transactions following the changes.

	One of the questions I’m regularly asked is how much longer cash has left as a pre-eminent payment method in the UK. It’s inevitable, people say, given the huge growth we’re seeing in digital, mobile and wearable forms of payment, that cash’s days are numbered.The answer isn’t that straightforward.Technology, as well as being the defining attribute of modern society, has given rise to a seismic shift in how businesses sell and consumers buy. In this transformation, it has given rise to rapid developments in payments: from Chip & PIN to e-commerce, contactless cards, mobile and wearable ways to pay. Consumers now have diverse payment opportunities that have brought with them additional convenience, security, choice and flexibility. They like this choice, and we see it in Barclaycard data showing that one in ten transactions made in the UK today is contactless and in London, contactless accounts for almost 4 in 10 of all card transactions £30 and under. Conversely, cash transactions have seen a steady decline - in 2015, cash accounted for 47% of all retail transactions, down from 52% in 2014. This is supported by Barclays’ own data which shows a year-on-year decrease in cash deposits, while the number of electronic transfers such as Bacs and Chaps is increasing. Though this evolution in modern payments has been at the expense of physical cash, rather than strongly preferring any one payment method, consumers simply like being able to pay in the way they want, when they want. This is echoed in the growing demand for a seamless omni-channel experience. Take Starbucks as an example, the success of its app as one of the largest mobile wallets globally, is because it offers customers the ability to collect the loyalty points, order on the mobile and collect their purchase in-store without having to queue, and to pay for their drink through it where they do buy in-store. It’s a fascinating example of how, where it works in both the merchant’s and consumer’s favour, new payments types can succeed. One role that the payments industry can usefully play is facilitating greater use of cross-channel digital payments by ensuring the necessary infrastructure is available, and that consumers and merchants have access to them.There are clear opportunities to do just that. Around under half of all UK SMEs do not accept credit and debit cards, despite this being the preferred way to pay for the vast majority of shoppers, and a fifth of small businesses admit they have no plans to introduce electronic payment options any time soon. They are consequently losing out on almost £9bn in sales.Furthermore, in the UK there are 3.5 million Britons who solely use cash due to their social and economic circumstances, including vulnerable members of society who do not have a bank account. Through the rollout of financial products such as ‘basic’ bank accounts and credit cards for those with limited credit history, increasing numbers of people have access to both payment cards and digital payment solutions for the first time.The UK has very few policies directly limiting the use of cash, but other countries are starting to use limits to reduce usage. For example, The Riksbank - Sweden’s Central Bank - has actively discouraged Swedes from using it and consequently cash now accounts for just a fifth of transactions in Sweden, well below the global average of three-quarters. And when it comes to shopping, 95% of Swedish retail sales are electronic. Swedish buses and the Stockholm metro do not accept cash, retailers are legally entitled to refuse coins and notes, while even street vendors and churches increasingly prefer card or phone payments. Whilst Sweden has gone further than most in reducing cash acceptance, the Nordics are not alone in its fast-increasing “cashlessness”. Singapore boasts the highest usage of payment cards in the world, accounting for almost two thirds of all transactions. And 40% of Koreans prefer to pay via card, leading The Bank of Korea to plan for a ""cashless society"" by 2020.For businesses, the benefits are financial and well as convenient. Cash doesn’t come for free - there are large sums involved in its production, transportation, storage and usage, and switching to newer payment methods can both speed up the purchasing process and give businesses greater customer insights.However, it’s important not to forget why customers adopted new payments technologies in the first place: convenience. Rather than necessarily removing the opportunity for people to pay in cash, the challenge for retailers is to accommodate the growing convergence of the online and offline worlds, and to create a seamless experience that mixes and matches the best of both. The challenge for payment providers is to support retailers in delivering that seamless experience, by making it easy and simple for them to accept a multitude of payment types. It remains to be seen if evangelists like Sweden will fully transition to cashless, in any case, these countries provide tremendous insight for nations following in their footsteps. But as always - listening to the customer is the key, providing ways to shop and pay, anytime, anywhere.",9572,1,782

	Often lauded as a country well on its way to becoming a cashless society, the Riksbank has taken a stand against moves to eliminate access to notes and coins in the country.In a statement submitted to the Ministry of Finance’s consultation on access to accounts with basic functions, the Riksbank called for a legal requirement to be introduced which would place a duty on banks to provide cash service as a basic feature of payment accounts. Signed by Stefan Ingves, the Riksbank Governor, the letter states that the banks have reduced their cash handling services too fast, resulting in a lack of cash services in less populated areas in particular, but for the public in general.The Riksbank says there are also clear signs that the supply of services is not meeting the demand and that this gap will increase if banks are allowed to continue setting the pace of the abolition of cash services. It calls on the Swedish parliament to introduce a clear obligation for banks to provide basic payment functions that meet customers’ needs.In a country where bank cards are routinely used for even the smallest purchases, there are less than 80 billion Swedish crowns in circulation (about EUR8 billion), a sharp decline from just six years ago, when the total in circulation was SEK106 billion.Mike Lee, CEO of the ATMIA, says: “This is a victory for common sense and for the future balance of the Swedish consumer economy and I’d like to congratulate the Swedish Riksbank for seeing through the mirage of anti-cash propaganda in the media to reveal the basic economic right of free citizens to choose their own payment methods at all times, whether cash or digital.”",24218,3,785

	Niklas Arvidsson, a researcher in industrial economics and management at KTH, says that the widespread and growing embrace of the mobile P2P payment system, Swish, is helping hasten the day when Sweden replaces cash altogether.""Cash is still an important means of payment in many countries' markets, but that no longer applies here in Sweden,"" Arvidsson says. ""Our use of cash is small, and it's decreasing rapidly.""In a country where bank cards are routinely used for even the smallest purchases, there are less than 80 billion Swedish crowns in circulation (about EUR8 billion), a sharp decline from just six years ago, when the total in circulation was SEK106 billion.""And out of that amount, only somewhere between 40 and 60 percent is actually in regular circulation,"" he says. The rest is socked away in people's homes and bank deposit boxes, or can be found circulating in the underground economy.The result of collaboration between major Swedish and Danish banks, Swish is a direct payment app that is used for transactions between individuals, in real time. But if Swish starts to be used on a larger scale and grows to include retail transactions and e-commerce, Arvidsson says the prospect of a cashless future will come ever closer to reality.Sweden will still have to ensure that all people are able to participate in a cashless payment system, Arvidsson acknowledges. The transformation would present serious challenges for those who are unfamiliar with computers and mobile phones — mainly older people living in rural areas.Other segments of the population likely to feel the impact are the homeless and undocumented immigrants.

We are also not aware of any other merchants who are experiencing this issue. We are reaching out to this merchant’s acquiring financial institution to offer assistance and to ensure cardholders are protected from unauthorised transactions. Visa does not reverse or resubmit transactions. That is not Visa’s role in the payment system. All transactions are submitted into Visa’s system by a financial institution, which for merchants is their acquiring bank.”The plot thickensIn a further update posted Saturday, Coinbase offered the following clarification: “Over the last two days, some customers who used a credit or debit card at Coinbase may have seen duplicate transactions posted to their cardholder accounts.

	Almost half of the 5000 UK consumers sampled by VocaLink identified bank involvement as a key driver in the move to mobile payments.
The research found that consumers are becoming more comfortable using mobile banking applications for more than just routine balance checks, as one-in-four now use their handset to transfer money to other people, move cash between accounts and view transaction histories on a regular basis - up from just seven percent two years ago.
Importantly, security concerns have become less of an issue in deterring mobile payments uptake, which remains nascent. Confusion over how mobile payments work in addition to a lack of knowledge around brands that operate in the space is proving more of an issue, creating an opportunity for banks to bridge the gap.

VocaLink says the core Zapp technology has been successfully built and delivered and pilots are being planned before the brand is introduced to the general public. Zapp says it intends to invest ""tens of millions of pounds"" in advertising and promotional activity, including a consumer education campaign, above the line advertising and promotional activity at the point of sale.Peter Keenan, chief executive of Zapp, comments: ""At last the promise of a truly mobile and digital payment method will become a reality, meaning easier and more secure checkouts for millions. It's amazing to have the support of such well known retailers. Together with our other partners this means millions of consumers will be able to shop at tens of thousands of merchants up and down the UK at launch.""

	Operating under the bPay brand, the wearables come with a brand new online portal and multi-platform app that will allow users to buy, manage and top-up their cash. Alternatively, customers can set their account to top-up automatically when their balance falls below a pre-set level.Available to all UK consumers, whether a Barclays' customer or not, the kit can be used to pay for transactions up to the value of £20, rising to £30 when the contactless payment limit is increased in September, at over 300,000 locations across the UK. The launch follows a successful one-year trial of Barclays' first generation of contactless wristbands, which pulled in up to 10,000 users. Registrations for the band spiked following Transport for London going contactless in September last year. The new range of devices will go on sale online on the brand new bPay e-store at www.bpay.co.uk from 1 July and will also be available to buy at high street retailers, beginning with the outdoor sports merchant Snow + Rock Group. Prices are £14.99 for the bPay sticker, £19.99 for the bPay fob and £24.99 for the bPay band.

	Set up by VocaLink earlier this year, Zapp is aiming to bring real-time mobile payments - in store, online and through apps - to millions of Brits by integrating its system into bank apps and tapping into the Faster Payments rails. The firm is on the verge of closing deals with up to three major high street banks, which will then invite customers to opt in to the service when it launches in the second half of next year. Bypassing the card networks, customers who choose to pay by Zapp will be taken to their banking app, where they will log in and confirm the purchase. Zapp argues that its system is both more convenient and secure than other options because customers do not need to hand over any card information. Instead a token that lasts only for a few minutes and has no intrinsic value but represents the request and authorisation of payment, is passed between the retailer, Zapp and customer's bank.The company admits that, for in-store purchases in particular, the convoluted log-in procedures some banks currently employ for their apps could put customers off. Zapp says that it is talking to banks about making these processes faster and is hoping to convince them of the merits of 'adaptive authentication' - a risk-based approach that lowers the log-in barriers for smaller payments.Despite the issues surrounding log-ins, Zapp CEO Peter Keenan says that the service has the potential to revolutionise in-store payments, freeing them from the checkout. For instance, customers in sandwich shops could pick up their food and pay via QR code and then flash their phone at a staff member on the way out of the shop to prove that they have paid. As well as QR codes, retailers could integrate Zapp with their contactless infrastructure. However, the firm says that its token-based system means that the secure element requirements normally associated with this technology becomes redundant.As well as bringing banks onboard, Zapp is also expecting to have several major retailers committed to the project within the next few weeks, lured in by promises of higher checkout completions and lower fees than those associated with card payments. Payments providers WorldPay Optimal Payments, Realex and SagePay have all already struck deals with the firm.Zapp is not only targeting the high street and e- and m-commerce firms, it is also setting itself up as a rival to the likes of iZettle and PayPal Here. The company's technology will let merchants such as plumbers accept payments, which will be processed immediately thanks to Faster Payments.Trials for the e- and m-commerce features, small business service and a bill payment option will begin next summer ahead of a full launch by the end of 2014, while in-store payments will follow shortly after.According to a report from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by Zapp, the value of mobile goods and services purchases will triple by 2018 to £14.2 billion. Confident of getting banks and merchants signed up, Zapp is hoping to win a significant share of this, setting a target of 20 million users and two billion transactions a year by 2017.VocaLink - owned by the banks - has invested heavily its venture, recently putting in another £17 million on top of an initial outlay of £16 million. However, Zapp says that it is still hoping to attract outside investment as it bids to secure a total of around £100 million to bring the service to launch, with much of the money earmarked for an aggressive marketing campaign.

Keenan is confident that with major banks behind it Zapp will flourish in a hugely competitive market. He insists that rival services such as the telco-owned Weve project are ""a good thing"" but argues that Brits are more likely to trust and adopt Zapp because of its closeness to banks.

	The new set of rules - dubbed MiFID II - are designed to close the loopholes in the existing legislation, and will apply to investment firms, market operators and services providing post-trade transparency information in the EU. They are set out in two pieces of legislation, a directly applicable regulation dealing with transparency and access to trading venues and a directive governing authorisation and organisation of trading venues and investor protection.Under the new regime, investment firms operating an internal matching or crossing system to execute client orders will have to be authorised as a Multilateral trading facility (MTF). It also introduces a new multilateral trading venue, the Organised Trading Facility (OTF), for non-equity instruments to trade on organised multilateral trading platforms. The OTFs will face a lighter regulatory regime than Regulated Markets, such as national stock exchanges.Financial markets commissioner Michel Barnier, says: ""Strict transparency rules will ensure that dark trading of shares and other equity instruments which undermine efficient and fair price formation will no longer be allowed. Although I regret that the Commission's proposed ambitious transparency regime for non-equity instruments, such as bonds and derivatives, has not been fully achieved, MiFID II represents an important step in the right direction towards greater transparency in this area.""The rules also impose restrictions on high frequency trading and the use of computer algorithms by investment firms. Algorithmic programmes will have to be first tested on approved markets by regulators, and include the use of circuit breakers to halt trading if price volatility gets too high. Moreover, records of all placed orders and cancellations of orders will have to be stored and made available to regulators upon request.""The dramatic increase in the speed and volumes of order flows can pose systemic risks, says Barnier. ""The new rules ensure safe and orderly markets and financial stability through the introduction of trading controls, an appropriate liquidity provision obligation for high-frequency traders pursuing market-making strategies and by regulating the provision of direct electronic market access.""From the Commission communique:Key elements of the agreement reached today by the co-legislators:(1) MiFID II introduces a market structure framework which closes loopholes and ensures that trading, wherever appropriate, takes place on regulated platforms. To this end, it subjects shares to a trading obligation. It further ensures that investment firms operating an internal matching system which executes client orders in shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments on a multilateral basis have to be authorised as a Multilateral trading facility (MTF). It also introduces a new multilateral trading venue, the Organised Trading Facility (OTF), for non-equity instruments to trade on organised multilateral trading platforms.These rules ensure a level playing field with Regulated Markets (RMs) and MTFs. The neutrality of OTF operators is ensured through restrictions on the use of own capital, including matched principal trading, and discretion in their execution policy. It introduces a trading obligation for shares as well as a trading obligation for derivatives which are eligible for clearing under the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and are sufficiently liquid. This will move trading in these instruments onto multilateral and well regulated platforms in accordance with the G-20 commitments.(2) MIFID II increases equity market transparency and for the first time establishes a principle of transparency for non-equity instruments such as bonds and derivatives. For equities a double volume cap mechanism limits the use of reference price waivers and negotiated price waivers (4% per venue cap and 8% global cap) together with a requirement for price improvement at the mid-point for the former. Large in scale waivers and order management waivers remains the same as under MiFID I. MiFID II also broadens the pre- and post-trade transparency regime to include non-equity instruments, although pre-trade transparency waivers are available for large orders, request for quote and voice trading. Post trade transparency is provided for all financial instruments with the possibility of deferred publication or volume masking as appropriate.Rules have also been established to enhance the effective consolidation and disclosure of trading data through the obligation for trading venues to make pre- and post-trade data available on a reasonable commercial basis and through the establishment of a consolidated tape mechanism for post-trade data. These rules are accompanied by the establishment of approved reporting mechanism (ARM) and authorised publication arrangement (APA) for trade reporting and publication.(3) To meet the G20 commitments, MiFID II provides for strengthened supervisory powers and a harmonised position-limits regime for commodity derivatives to improve transparency, support orderly pricing and prevent market abuse. Under this system competent authorities will impose limits on persons' positions in accordance with a methodology for calculation set by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). It also introduces a position-reporting obligation by category of trader. This will help regulators and market participants to have better information on the functioning of these markets.(4) A new framework will improve conditions for competition in the trading and clearing of financial instruments. This is essential for the integration of efficient and safe EU capital markets. For this purpose, MiFID establishes a harmonised EU regime for non-discriminatory access to trading venues and central counterparties (CCPs).Smaller trading venues and newly established CCPs will benefit from optional transition periods. The non-discriminatory access regime will also apply to benchmarks for trading and clearing purposes. Transitional rules will ensure the smooth application of these provisions.(4) MiFID II will introduce trading controls for algorithmic trading activities which have dramatically increased the speed of trading and can cause systemic risks. These safeguards include the requirement for all algorithmic traders to be properly regulated and to provide liquidity when pursuing a market-making strategy. In addition, investment firms which provide direct electronic access to a trading venue will be required to have in place systems and risk controls to prevent trading that may contribute to a disorderly market or involve market abuse.(5) Stronger investor protection is achieved by introducing better organisational requirements, such as client asset protection or product governance, which also strengthen the role of management bodies. The new regime also provides for strengthened conduct rules such as an extended scope for the appropriateness tests and reinforced information to clients. Independent advice is clearly distinguished from non-independent advice and limitations are imposed on the receipt of commissions (inducements). MiFID also introduces harmonised powers and conditions for ESMA to prohibit or restrict the marketing and distribution of certain financial instruments in well-defined circumstances and similar powers for the European Banking Authority (EBA) in the case of structured deposits. Concerning Packaged Retail Investment Products (PRIPS), the new framework also covers structured deposits and amends the Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) to introduce some rules for insurance-based investment products.(6) The agreement strengthens the existing regime to ensure effective and harmonised administrative sanctions. The use of criminal sanctions is framed so as to ensure the cooperation between authorities and the transparency of sanctions. A harmonised system of strengthened cooperation will improve the effective detection of breaches of MIFID.(7) A harmonised regime for granting access to EU markets for firms from third countries is based on an equivalence assessment of third country jurisdictions by the Commission. The regime applies only to the cross-border provision of investment services and activities provided to professional and eligible counterparties. For a transitional period of three years and then pending equivalence decisions by the Commission, national third-country regimes continue to apply.

	IOActive researcher Ariel Sanchez used iPhones and iPads to test 40 home banking apps from some of the biggest financial institutions around the world.
The testing found that 90% of the apps contain non-SSL links, enabling any attacker to intercept traffic and inject code in an attempt to create a fake login prompt or similar scam.
Meanwhile, half of the apps are vulnerable to JavaScript injections via insecure UIWebView implementations. In some cases, the native iOS functionality is exposed, allowing crooks to do things like send SMS or e-mails from the victim's device.
Many apps - 40% - do not validate the authenticity of SSL certificates presented, leaving them open to man-in-the-middle attacks. Nearly three quarters also don't have multi-factor authentication, which could help to mitigate the risk of impersonation attacks.
IOActive says that it has contacted some of the banks about vulnerabilities but argues that the entire industry needs to step up its efforts to protect customers.
Among its suggestions are that all connections are performed using secure transfer protocols, SSL certificate checks are enforced, and the iOS data protection API is used to encrypt sensitive data.

The latest findings also show that fewer than one in ten (nine percent) mobile and smartphone owners know that their device is NFC-enabled, and of these just over a fifth (22%) ever use it to make payments.  YouGov says there is ""strong resistance"" to the technology among non-adopters. More than half of mobile phone owner that are not interested in NFC-enabled technology (56%) do not believe that the technology is safe to use and a similar number (53%) are concerned about their financial exposure if their phone were lost or stolen. Moreover, given general contentment with using Chip & PIN at the check-out, almost four in ten (39%) say they do not see a need for the technology.By contrast, the UK experienced strong growth in both the awareness and usage of contactless payment cards in the year to September 2013. Awareness of the technology grew from 55% to 70% during the period and acknowledged ownership increased from 16% to 25%. However, general uptake was more limited with only four in ten (40%) owners ever using their contactless card, primarily due to only partial adoption by UK merchants.  John Gilbert, consulting director YouGov Technology & Telecoms says: ""Despite the advances in NFC mobile technology, the industry has yet to increase the awareness nor put forth a compelling value proposition to the consumer to adopt NFC payments.  In addition, retail adoption is rather limited curbing the consumers' desire to transition.""   ",9260,13,826

	To use Payment Code, a customer opens the PayPal app in-store and checks in. The app then generates a QR code and four digit code. If the shop has a barcode or QR code scanner, the phone is simply passed over it to make a purchase. Alternatively the code is entered into the POS PIN pad. While the process fails to make paying at the checkout simpler than the old-fashioned card, PayPal argues that the real benefit to customers is the ability to automatically redeem things like special offers, gift cards and rewards programmes.Meanwhile, merchants can tap into the 2D barcode scanners they already have in-store, rather than having to pay out for new hardware such as NFC-enabled terminals. PayPal also stresses that retailers which already have a mobile app for their customers can still use the feature, integrating it into their own offering. Payment Code - launched today at the Money2020 conference, but not to be rolled out in the first quarter of next year - is an advance on PayPal's previous big checkout effort, deployed by retailers such as Home Depot, which required customers to use a physical 'Access' card or punch in a mobile phone number and PIN into the terminal.The eBay unit is also experimenting with Bluetooh Low Energy technology, which can enable a transaction to take place without having to open up an app, without GPS being turned on, and even without a phone signal for establishments with thick concrete walls.Meanwhile, in the UK it has been trialling mobile payments technology which lets customers verify themselves at the checkout using just a photo and their first name.

	As part of its new Fintech Roadmap initiative, the EBA has published two reports: one looking into the impact of fintech on incumbents' business models and another on the prudential risks and opportunities arising from fintech.
Credit institutions can be split into three camps, says the EBA: proactive, reactive, and passive. 
""Potential risks may arise both for incumbents not able to react adequately and timely, remaining passive observers, but also for aggressive front-runners that alter their business models without a clear strategic objective in mind, backed by appropriate governance, operational and technical changes,"" warns the authority.
The report identifies four main drivers shaping incumbents' attitudes to changing business models: customer expectations and behaviour; profitability concerns; increased competition; and the regulatory framework.
On competition, banks are still keen to collaborate with fintech firms, seeing them as partners rather than threats. However, incumbents are worried about big tech firms, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon stepping on their toes.
Risks to business model sustainability mostly stem from incumbent institutions’ ability and capacity to adapt and their speed of doing so. Says the report: ""This is particularly challenging for some large complex incumbents that have a very formal and slow governance structure, further restricted by legacy ICT systems or legacy non-performing assets.""
The second EBA report explores seven technology use cases: biometric authentication; the use of robo-advisors; the use of big data and machine learning for credit scoring; the use of DLT and smart contracts for trade finance; the use of DLT to streamline customer due diligence; mobile wallets and NFC; and outsourcing core banking and payment systems to the public cloud.
So far, significant implementations of these sophisticated technologies has been missing, possibly because of security concerns and efforts to filter the fintech hype, says the EBA, adding: ""From the prudential risks' perspective, there is a growing shift towards operational risk, arising mainly from the accentuation of ICT risks as institutions move towards more technology-based solutions.""

	The Roadmap sketches out the EBA's priorities for monitoring emerging trends and analysing the impact on incumbent institutions' business models. Key to this will be a thoroughgoing assessment of current authorisation and licencing approaches to finech firms and a best practice guide for regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs. The EBA says it wants to address consumer issues arising from fintech development ""in particular in the areas of unclear regulatory status of fintech firms and related disclosure to consumers, potential national barriers preventing fintech firms from scaling up services to consumers across the single market, and the appropriateness of the current regulatory framework for virtual currencies"".In a preview ahead of the publication of the Roadmap, EBA chairperson Andrea Enria last week said the Authority was minded to avoid granting any official regulation to the cryptocurrency sector, instead using existing rules on anti-money laundering to protect consumers and barring banks from dealing in virtual currencies.While ensuring that fintech firms and the services that they are offer are properly governed, Enria was keen to stress that these companies should not be treated the same as banks, which provide liquidity, debit and credit: ""An excessive extension of the regulatory perimeter, attracting most fintech firms under the scope of bank-like supervision just because they compete with banks in some market segment, is likely to be a sub-optimal solution.""In terms of security and financial stability, the EBA intends to additionally promote a common cyber threat testing framework and identify money laundering/terrorist financing risks associated with regulated fintech firms, technology providers and business models. Says Enria: ""The EBA's Knowledge Hub will ensure that EU supervisors share best practices and adopt a technologically neutral approach to the application of new technologies in the financial sector.

Having overcome previous industry objections to the implementation of over-onerous customer authentication standards, the published RTS also dropped an unexpected bomb shell in a commitment to outlaw screen scraping in favour of bank-led access to client data under APIs.The suggestion caused an outcry among mature fintech startups, who have lobbied hard for a reversal of the decision, claiming that the reforms will provide banks with the means to control what data is shared, putting new entrants at a disadvantage.The European Commission subsequently intervened on their behalf, asking the EBA not to ban screen scraping outright but to hold it in reverse as a back-up mechanism should bank interfaces fail to function properly. This has led to a strong push back from banks, who claim that the amendments take no account of the burden of compliance and would jeopardise the privacy of client data, cybersecurity and innovation.In response, the EBA has come down firmly on the side of the banks: ""The EBA is of the view that imposing such a fallback requirement would go beyond the legal mandate given to the EBA under Article 97 PSD2. The EBA is also sceptical about the extent to which the proposed amendment would achieve the desired objectives and efficiently address market concerns. Indeed, the EBA has identified a number of risks that would arise were PSPs to implement the Commission’s proposal.""Instead, the rule-marker has suggested a compromise entailing more rigorous checks and balances on bank APIs alongside a set of minimum performance and availability standards that would release compliant banks from the burden of providing a screen-scraping fall back.""It is now for the EU Commission to make the final decision on the text of the RTS and to adopt the standards as a delegated Act in the Official Journal of the EU,"" says the EBA. ""During the adoption process, the EU Council and EU Parliament have a scrutiny right. Once the RTS have been published in the Official Journal, they will enter into force the following day and will apply 18 months after that date.""

	Coming into effect at the end of May, GDPR will create a harmonised data protection law framework across the EU with the aim of giving citizens back control of their personal data, whilst imposing strict rules on those hosting, moving and processing it.As part of its efforts to comply with the new rule, Rabobank has teamed up with IBM to cryptographically transform terabytes of its most sensitive client data - including names, birthdates and account numbers - into a desensitised representation, meaning it looks and behaves like the real data, but is not.Identifying fields within a data record are replaced by pseudonyms, i.e. replacing a real name with a fictitious one. In addition, for GDPR the data is also processed in such a way that it can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. The partners have been working on the project for the last year, with multiple key applications and platforms already pseudonymised, including the current bank account and savings systems on mainframe, Linux, Tandem and Windows platforms. Ultimately, the project will pseudonymise all payments applications and expand into other functional areas within the bank.Michael Osborne, cryptographer, IBM Research, says: ""IBM analytics software combined with our cryptographic desensitisation engine achieves pseudonymisation by converting the data into individual hash-based token keys which are completely impermeable today and in the future, even from a fault-tolerant quantum computer many years from now.""The move not only helps with GDPR compliance, says Rabobank, it also makes it easier for its so-called Radical Automation DevOps team to use the data for performance testing of new technologies and services, such as mobile apps and payment solutions.Peter Claassen, delivery manager, radical automation, Rabobank, says: ""Being able to test and iterate using pseudonymised data is going to unleash new innovations from our DevOps team bringing even more security, innovation and convenience to our clients.""

	The report, commissioned by security outfit AllClear ID, estimates that financial institutions may experience 384 data breaches during the timeframe, with fines as high as €260m per breach. The figures were compiled from an analysis of historic data breach figures, adjusted for the size of financial institution. GDPR sanction levels were then applied to the data. It was assumed that breaches were at the lower end of the GDPR fine scale, which is €10m or 2% of global annual turnover.Consult Hyperion stresses that the €4.7 billion figure is a conservative forecast, as it excludes compensation claims, costs associated with lost customers, damaged reputations and senior executive resignations.“The highest risk item in the GDPR is the 72-hour breach notification requirement, and banks are not mitigating this,” says Tim Richards, principal consultant, Consult Hyperion. “Data breaches are an unfortunate fact of life for financial institutions, and our analysis suggests that there have been no fewer than 27 data breach incidents among European Tier 1 banks in the last decade, with some banks as multiple offenders, potentially liable for fines at the 4% level. This indicates an 8% chance that any Tier 1 bank will suffer a data breach in any given year.” He says that new European regulations such as PSD2, ePR and AMLD4/5 are likely to compound the issue by opening additional liabilities.With less than a year before GDPR goes live the report advises banks to take urgent action by drafting in the expertise to deal with breach-specific issues and to handle the volume of queries generated when data loss is publicised.

But the technology raises a host of ethical considerations; earlier this month Singapore brought together industry players to work on guidelines for its ""responsible and ethical"" use in the financial services sector.
In a new report, the House of Lords Select Committee on AI concludes that the UK is in a strong position to become a world leader in the area, providing a major boost to the economy. The report outlines five key principles that should form the basis of a cross-sector code, which can be adopted nationally and internationally:
AI should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity.
    AI should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness.
    AI should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or communities.
    All citizens should have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally, emotionally and economically alongside AI.
    The autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive human beings should never be vested in AI.
The report also says that government should make significant investments in skills and training to mitigate the effect of AI on job losses as well as give people greater control over their data and prevent big tech firms monopolising data.
Committee chairman Lord Clement-Jones, says: ""AI is not without its risks and the adoption of the principles proposed by the Committee will help to mitigate these. An ethical approach ensures the public trusts this technology and sees the benefits of using it. It will also prepare them to challenge its misuse.""Want to learn more about how AI is upending traditional financial services?

	Not a cyborg, the RBS Assist hybrid bot is a tool that customers can message with everyday queries. The bot uses cloud-based AI developed by LivePerson alongside self-service software from Nanorep to intelligently answer or ""surface"" answers to frequently asked questions.But unlike most bots, it is integrated with other customer service channels, handing off conversations, back and forth, with human agents. The AI handles routine, administrative tasks, while people take on the more complex, meaningful interactions.The technology, which started live testing in January, includes natural language processing techniques with machine learning algorithms, enabling RBS to analyse every single line of text that its customers enter during a conversation. Bot conversations will be rated in real time as positive, negative or neutral, which will help RBS determine when human intervention or support is needed.Katie Ayaz, head, digital services, RBS, says: says, ""We're pleased to be a leader in deploying AI and messaging technologies to serve our customers consistently and with high quality. Intelligent customer engagement using LivePerson technology has already helped us to reduce operational costs and drive higher net promoter scores.""

	In an inhouse Q&A, Abele, who is head of digital private banking at Credit Suisse Switzerland, insists that digital and analog are ""not binaries"" and that new technology will help advisors by taking on repetitive admin, leaving more time for clients.Some of the bank's advisors began piloting new technology this summer, using tablets with speech recognition that takes over documentation, freeing up staffers to focus on clients. The tablet also gives advisors virtual access to experts who can be digitally brought in to answer any questions. ""What is special about it is that we did not roll out a ready-to-use solution but rather one that the client advisors themselves can help to design. Ultimately, we want the technology to be the perfect support for our advisors,"" says Abele.This means that advisors are not likely to be replaced by robots in the near future. Despite much hype, independent robo-advisors only manage around $20 billion around the world, although this is expected to rise to $450 billion by 2020.Abele notes that most of these platforms are focused exclusively on exchange traded funds, making them inadequate for many clients, while they are also geographically limited - many of them in the US, which is not ""consistent with the security requirements"" of most Swiss clients.Even when automated advisors overcome these problems, humans will still have a place, with the technology allowing them to offer tools to less wealthy people - something another Swiss Bank, UBS, has started doing in the UK.More generally, Abele calls fintech firms ""no small phenomenon"" but is sceptical on their chances of replacing banks, largely because they focus on only a part of the value chain. He suggests that cooperation is the best route for both sides. But banks must still be vigilant: ""The generation of today's 15- to 35-year-olds seeks out the offer that suits them best. Whether that offer comes from a 160-year-old bank or a social network is completely irrelevant. We have to offer the best solution or they will go somewhere else.""

	China's A-Share market is only accessible to profitable companies, ruling it out as a fund raising option for the many fintech startups that have yet to make it into the red. This is especially true for the P2P lending platforms which have come under pressure ever since China issued new rules for the fledgling sector in 2016.
These rules, prompted by a number of fraud cases, mandate that P2P lenders appoint an independent custodian bank to oversee the use of deposits and also disclose more information about their operations. Consequently many P2P lenders are looking to raise more funds to cover the cost of compliance with the new rules and are looking overseas. 
“An increasing number of fintech IPOs in Hong Kong and the United States are expected to take place,” said Gao Jianbin, a PwC partner, speaking to the South China Morning Post. “They mainly aim to list in the US, though Hong Kong is also an option.”
Some of the larget Chinese fintechs taking such a step include Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, which has a customer base of more than 500m and is looking to raise up to $1.5m via a Hong Kong IPO. 
Others include Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange (Lufax) and Ant Financial, formerly known as Alipay, as well as a number of P2P lenders such as Ppdai.com, Neo Capital and Dianrong.
Should there be a spate of overseas IPOs, China's financial authorities will be left with a balancing act to perform - to encourage the development of homegrown fintechs but within the framework of an orderly and disciplined equity market structure. 
Previously the China Securities Regulatory Commission considered creating a listing venue at the Shanghai Stock Exchnage for its largest finetch firms and other emerging industries but the plan was abandoned in March 2015. And just this week China's authorities issued an immediate ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), an alternative and cryptocurrency-based way of raising finance, ruling that they were a threat to financial stability.
Analysts believe IPOs are vital for fintech firms to boost their businesses, repelenish their capital and also attract talent but many of them maybe forced to do so overseas in the short term.
And there could well be a number of international exchange venues happy to compete for the business. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has recently announced it is setting up a new board to attract listings of technology companies, which could include China’s fintech businesses.

In 2015 the German bank announced plans to cut more than 30,000 jobs over two years as part of a drastic restructuring plan designed to save €3.8bn. Many of these job losses were sustained in back-office and IT roles as the bank looked to reorganise its IT infrastructure and cut its use of legacy or duplicate technology.

The areas with the highest correlation with profit­ability were product back-office automation, digitisation of document management and automation of credit decisions, and big data analytics applied to sales campaigns.

	A survey of 107 industry professionals, carried out by Misys with Finextra, shows that marginal growth is coming from new ventures offering add-ons such as real-time payments services and supply chain finance programmes.
However, respondents expect the biggest growth to come from unleashing the potential of more automated payments, being able to streamline trade finance processing and offering  unified online channels for corporate transaction banking across trade, cash and treasury functions.
Regional differences in the potential for growth and demand for transaction services are evident from the poll, with more than a third of those quizzed saying that they see Asia Pacific having the highest potential, while 30% say Europe is their main focus.
Wisam Mahmood, global product director, Misys, says: ""Increasingly corporates are demanding more joined up ways of looking across their transactions to better assess working capital and risks in their business, and we are seeing banks reacting to these demands, region by region.
""To maximise the return on their transaction banking business, banks are focusing on getting the fundamental infrastructure that mobilises their payments and trade finance business right in order to capitalise on new and future opportunities in the corporate banking market.""
The growing commoditisation of payments is another challenge emerging more strongly, with 58% of respondents highlighting it this year, compared with 46% last year. As it becomes harder to differentiate with standard payment products and services, banks are under increasing pressure to achieve greater efficiency in existing areas - and scale them at a regional or global level - while also directing resources to new product development and delivery.
In last year's survey, 80% said adding new online services was a strategic priority and many have stuck to that roadmap, with 85% now offering an online portal for corporates.
The results also show that banks are focusing on improving the quality of their payments operations: 81% say that reducing manual exceptions is a priority, indicative of the fact that incremental improvements in straight-through processing can still yield significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.

The exchange, which partnered ClientKnowledge to survey 952 FX active organisations, found banks citing settlement risk as their biggest concern when supplying e-pricing, up to 69% from 52% last year. Worries about counterparty risk remain high, with two-thirds of those surveyed citing it as a concern in 2009. Concern about latency saw a 13% increase, up from 16% to 29%.

When assessing systemic risk, investors are more concerned by economic problems than banks. Back office and settlement limitations emerge as the biggest concern for banks, increasing to 47%, up more than twice the 16% cited in 2008. Worries about a liquidity crunch dropped significantly from 51% in 2008 to 33% in 2009, and credit or bank insolvency remains nearly unchanged at 26%.
Investors are more concerned about credit/bank insolvency in their view of exposure. Highly active investors' concern over credit/bank insolvency is at 44%, up from 36% in 2008. Liquidity concerns, the topmost worry in 2008, came in second at 36%. Worries regarding macro-economic problems jumped back up to 31%, from 14% in 2008.
In employing options, banks and investors placed more focus on plain vanilla options versus barrier and exotic options, suggesting that both banks and investors are making the move back to simplicity, liquidity and transparency, says the CME. Trading more complex options may be a more effective hedge now, but managing the risk over the life of the derivative still remains a major consideration.
David Poole, COO, ClientKnowledge, says: ""The combination of the global credit crisis and development of e-trading has resulted in a greater focus on post-trade services, risk management and increased efficiency. FX market participants are balancing taking advantage of opportunities for increased revenue whilst accounting for market, settlement and systemic risk.""
Meanwhile, separate research from Greenwich Associates shows that hedge fund managers are enacting a series of operational changes to reduce risk and enhance their ability to attract investors in the wake of the financial crisis.
The study examining the operational practices of over 50 hedge funds, commissioned by Omgeo, found that 70% of participating managers have altered their operations to reduce counterparty risk.
Almost 60% of managers have increased the number of prime brokers with whom they work - a move that virtually all say is intended to reduce counterparty risk. At the same time, nearly 40% have taken steps to enhance reporting and increase transparency for investors, and about one-third have started to obtain more independent valuations and accounting.
More than two-thirds of the hedge funds participating in the survey believe operational improvements and automation have a direct and positive impact on their ability to attract investors and assets.
Andrew McCollum, consultant, Greenwich Associates, says: ""There's a real change of behaviour going on, the days in which investors would entrust their money to the black box of a skilled hedge fund manager are over. In the post-crisis marketplace, investors are demanding not only transparency, but also sophisticated operational processes and infrastructures capable of managing the types of risks they've experienced over the past 18 months.""

	Launched in November 2016, Stockholm Fintech Hub is home to 200 startups and other large tech players like IBM and Microsoft.Having already cemented relationships with similar spaces in Oslo, Helsinki and Copenhagen, Nordea's participation in the Swedish hub rounds off the bank's connections to the startup ecosystem across Scandinavia, ""It is critical for us to be where innovation is happening,"" says Ewan Macleod, head of digital at Nordea. ""As a big bank, we are constantly forced to hit the ground running so we can develop the right technologies and the right services for our customer quickly.

	MobilePay has established itself as Denmark's leading m-payments service, with millions of people using it for P2P transfers and in-store and online purchases. Danske Bank is now opening up the platform to all Nordic banks, with Nordea the first to sign on, offering the service to its customers in Denmark and Norway.The move means that Nordea is abandoning Swipp - the MobilePay rival it owns with dozens of local banks - and will now pump money into Danske Bank's offering.Two years ago Swipp bought Paii, another rival outfit formed by a group of Danish telcos, with the express intention of knocking MobilePay off its perch.Today's news is a blow for Nordic payments processor Nets because it will be removed from the equation when Nordea customers use MobilePay, meaning it will no longer receive fees from Danske.Nets, which floated last month, saw shares fall by more than six per cent today.Nordea and Danske say that they have decided to join forces to give them a better chance of seeing off fierce and growing competition from international behemoths such as Google, Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile, with other banks in Denmark, Norway and Finland expected to follow Nordea's lead, Danske says it will convert MobilePay into a subsidiary with its own board of directors. A MobilePay route into Sweden could also be on the cards, with the firm saying it is eager to talk to Swish about allowing payments between the two services.

	As the deadline for full implementation of AMLD4 hits, a survey of nearly 200 UK professionals by LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that 73% think it will make preventing money laundering easier. This marks a significant shift in attitudes from two years ago, when just 17% thought the directive would make a change and 32% thought it would make no difference.However, there is likely to be an associated cost. Research from Consult Hyperion for Mitek suggests that the average UK bank already wastes £5 million a year on manual and inefficient KYYC processes. With AMLD4 and the anticipated AMLD5 increasing the frequency and scope of these essential checks, the annual waste is likely to double to £10 million a year, claims the report.Total costs for KYC processes range from £10 to £100 per check and, in the UK, a quarter of applications are abandoned due to KYC friction. What's more, AMLD4 will impose fines as high as 10% of annual turnover for serious breaches.Consult Hyperion says that eIDs for digital onboarding are still several years away from being widely available but that mobile technology could save millions of pounds on KYC costs.""The message to all financial institutions is clear: The cost of KYC checks is much too high, placing too much reliance on inefficient and error-prone manual processes,"" says Steve Pannifer, COO, Consult Hyperion.

	The paper reflects on a growing debate in the economics community and academia about whether technological progress threatens to displace a large proportion of lower-skilled jobs in the longer term. The prevailing view is that technological progress has always been labour-augmenting in the past, and is likely to remain so in future, as jobs dependent on human traits such as creativity, emotional intelligence and social skills may become more numerous.The BofE blog takes a more dystopian perspective, pointing out that the speed of technological progress and the mass of adoption of robotics threatens to disrupt many industries more-or-less simultaneously, giving neither the economy — nor society in general — the time to adapt to the changes. Indeed, a recent report by Deloitte concluded that around one-third of jobs in the UK are at “high risk” of being displaced by automation over the next two decades, including losses of over 2 million jobs in retail, 1½ million jobs in transportation and storage, and 1¼ million jobs in health and social care.The blog points to growing concern in the global tech community that developed economies are poorly prepared for the next industrial revolution. ""That might herald the displacement of millions of predominantly lesser-skilled jobs, the failure of many longstanding businesses which are slow to adapt, a large increase in income inequality in society, and growing industrial concentration associated with the rapid growth of a relatively small number of multi-national technology corporations,"" the authors write. ""Economists looking at previous industrial revolutions observe that none of these risks have transpired. However, this possibly under-estimates the very different nature of the technological advances currently in progress, in terms of their much broader industrial and occupational applications and their speed of diffusion. It would be a mistake, therefore, to dismiss the risks associated with these new technologies too lightly.""

	Year In Review: 2016
1. Emergence of new business models for banks
Historically, bank CEO’s haven’t pushed innovation hard enough, preferring to satisfy shareholders than to bring new methods to customers. However, in 2016 in particular they’re now fully realising they fall short when it comes to innovation, and are gobbling up small fintech startups faster than ever. Now a quarter (25%) of global banks would buy a fintech company, and 60% would partner with one - I consider this to be incredibly positive both for businesses and customers alike.
2. PSD2, Open Banking
The very idea of sharing banking data could set alarm bells ringing in the minds of many ordinary consumers in terms of security and privacy. As a result, the use of APIs in banking has largely been limited. However, Open Banking really ramped up this year and will give the European banking industry the shake up it needs in the coming year.
The benefits of sharing this data, which gained real traction this year due to PSD2 - with customer consent - greatly outweigh the risks as it will help increase transparency, competitiveness and foster innovation that should ultimately benefit consumers.
3. Biometrics
This year saw the take off a wide variety of biometric security measures from financial organisations. From fingerprints to facial recognition are moving beyond the realm of science fiction to our everyday banking transactions. Passwords are problematic, and in the digital age customers struggle to keep track of their many passwords for different services which can, in many cases, easily be hacked.
Biometric authentication is undeniably the future of mobile security and it’s a hugely positive step that big players are starting to put customer experience at the heart of their processes. For example, HSBC this year announced its plan to introduce selfie authentication for setting up customer accounts, while Mastercard has built fingerprint sensors into cards, offering increased security and a smoother banking experience at the same time.Year Ahead: 2017
1. Artificial intelligence / Chatbots
Up to this point artificial intelligence (AI) in banking has been a critical, but mainly ‘backroom’ technology used by financial organisations, especially challenger banks, to unearth deep customer insights and offer them personalised products.
However, we’re now in an era where customers expect quicker, more responsive services from their banks and this coming year will see the full roll out of AI-driven solutions which aim to meet these heightened expectations, while also ensuring consumers receive the personalised approach they also demand.
Chatbots, which answer customers’ inquiries and resolve their problems, will become the new norm for banking customers around the world next year. We’ve seen a number of test cases deployed in 2016 but many of the big players including Mastercard, will be jumping head first into offering chatbot services for their customers in 2017.
From an industry perspective, next year will be a big opportunity to really prove how effective consumer-facing AI solutions such as chatbots can be, when applied to everyday customer service.
2. Account aggregation / PSD2 premises
With the Payments Services Directive (PSD2) scheduled to be enforced in 2017, it will grant access to customer bank accounts and transaction data to third-party providers via a dedicated set of application program interfaces (APIs). As customer data opens up across Europe, account aggregation, whereby compiling information from disparate, different financial accounts for a consumer, will likely be a key growth area.
In practice, what this means is that financial institutions can become central to a customer’s daily transactions, regardless of what accounts they might come from. Meanwhile for the industry, organisations can gain deeper insights into individual consumers and what financial products might appeal to them currently, or in the future. Also, the wealth of data available will result in continued innovation of financial products which will put the customer at the heart of their development.
3. SME banking
While fintech innovation in the last number of years has been primarily focused on the retail banking sector, this will change markedly in 2017, as corporate banking comes to the fore.
One segment on this market which will be affected will be smaller to medium-sized firms. The UK is home to over five million SMEs, yet 85% of business current accounts (BCA) and almost 90% of business loans are provided by four providers currently, with just a 4% annual BCA switching rate.
Some challenges SMEs currently experience with incumbent banks are lengthy and complex procedures to open bank accounts preventing them to run their operations smoothly meantime or the fact that the accounts they offer are fitted to large corporation needs and not SME’s. This is where fintech is ideally placed in the coming year to take on established financial institutions and offer real value to SMEs to enable their businesses to thrive in a challenging environment.

	MasterCard's Decision Intelligence goes beyond current risk assessment profiling by assessing, scoring and learning from each transaction. It examines how a specific account is used over time to detect normal and abnormal shopping spending behaviors, using account information like customer value segmentation, risk profiling, location, merchant, device data, time of day, and type of purchase made.The data is fed back to the issuer and used to adjust risk scores for the next transaction.Earlier this year, the card scheme rolled out MasterCard IQ, an authorisation and assurance toolkit designed to provide deeper insights into cardholder spending habits in a split-second. Authorization IQ uses the unique and historical behavior of the card to predict and assess risk against a current transaction. The Assurance kit enables the exchange of information from the merchant about the particular circumstances of a transaction to help provide a more nuanced risk score. Research by Javelin shows that the value of false declines per year has hit $118 billion, more than 13 times the total amount lost annually to actual card fraud ($9 billion). Not only are such refusals more likely to hit more affluent consumers who spend more on big ticket items, they also have a negative rebound in customer attitude towards the bank and merchant. “We are solving a major consumer pain point of being falsely declined when trying to make a purchase,” sayus Ajay Bhalla, president of enterprise risk and security, Mastercard. “By using AI technology on our global network, we’re helping financial institutions and merchants improve approval rates - and the consumer experience.”

	Currently, people with gambling addictions who want to stop themselves from placing bets have to contact various different providers to block their accounts. With nearly one per cent of the UK population reporting a gambling problem, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute has been calling for banks and other card providers to make the situation easier by allowing customers to simply block all gambling transactions on their cards.Starling is now doing this, offering customers the chance to activate the blocker as an opt-in feature from the bank's app, meaning that all attempted transactions to registered gambling merchants will be declined. If they turn the feature off because they want to start gambling again, customers will get a message saying: “You are cancelling the block you put in place to prevent you from gambling. If you are worried you spend more than you should on gambling, call the National Gambling Helpline now on 0808 8030 133 for free advice on how to stay in control.”Anne Boden, CEO, Starling, says: ""Starling’s gambling blocker underlines how digital banking can quickly react to issues facing customers and use technology to develop solutions that help them to live a better financial life. ""This isn’t about telling customers not to gamble - it’s about providing problem gamblers with a simple and effective tool that can help them to regain control over their finances.""Starling says that its feature is an industry first but last month Monzo introduced something similar, giving customers the option to block payments to gambling merchants through the company, both online and in person.Monzo's system actually requires customers who want to turn the block off to call the bank and speak to a rep. Even then, the restrictions are not lifted for 48 hours.

	The UK fintech sector currently employs some 76,500 people, of whom 42% are from overseas - 28% from European Economic Area (EEA) countries, and 14% from non-EEA countries. London's booming fintech market is viewed as a major success story and lauded by the Government as a key contributor to UK economic performance. Innovate Finance estimates that the sector is set to grow to more than 100,000 employees, and the number of UK fintech companies more than double to 3,300, by the year 2030. However, 82% of companies say they already face difficulties in recruiting non-EEA migrants. Under the most likely scenario for future immigration policy, in which the system for EEA migrants moves closer to that for non-EEA migrants, the report predicts a shortfall of 3,200 highly-skilled workers by 2030, at a cost to the UK fintech sector of £361m. Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation say: “As the financial services sector increasingly turns to technology to shape its future, it’s essential that the UK is able to attract international talent to unlock the full potential of this thriving industry. This data shines a spotlight on the urgent need to clarify an immigration policy for European workers ahead of the UK’s departure from the bloc in March next year."" Innovate Finance, which represent the views of some 250 paid-up members, has called on the Government to adapt a more flexible and proportionate policy on immigration and to redefine the meaning of “highly-skilled” worker in today’s global jobs market. Charlotte Crosswell, CEO of Innovate Finance says: “Access to talent is a perennial issue, and one which affects all sectors of our economy. This is not in light of Brexit, but Brexit shines a light on it and risks exacerbating the issue further. Without a flexible approach, the UK fintech sector stands to lose its global pre-eminence with fintech companies already facing challenges in recruiting appropriate skills and talent.""

""I am committed to helping the sector grow and flourish, and our ambitious Sector Strategy sets out how we will ensure the UK remains at the cutting edge of the digital revolution.""Topping the bill, the Cryptoassets Task Force consisting of HM Treasury, the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority will scrutinise the risks related to digital currencies and seek to harness the benefits of the underlying blockchain technology for the wider financial sector. Hammond is also pushing for the creation of a new set of industry standards to enable fintech firms to more easily partner with banks and the creation of software to help startups navigate the regulatory maze.Recognising the the regional input from firms based outside London, the Government will also appoint three new Fintech Regional Envoys to ensure the benefits from the strategy are felt the length and breadth of the country.At the conference the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, will also announce that Tech City UK is building a comprehensive Fintech Programme across the country to support new companies in the sector across the UK.Specifically, TechCity's Fintech Delivery Panel is working with Barclays’ Connect with Work programme that sets out to find and recruit people over 16 with the right aptitude and attitude to work in fintech, but who face barriers to doing so. It is also collaborating with the British Standards Institute and five major banks to help banks and startups achieve partnerships faster. The aim is to produce a set of onboarding guidelines that fintech companies can use to assess their readiness to partner with a major financial institution. TechCity has additionally committed to rolling out a six-month long accelerator programme specifically for early-stage fintech B2B companies.The day-long event will also welcome Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison - a self-professed 'fintech junkie' - who will co-sign a new Fintech Bridge agreement designed to support startups as they enter each territory and harmonise policies across a range of issues relevant to the sector.Says Hammond: ""Today’s UK-Australia Fintech Bridge agreement is our most ambitious to date. It will bring together our regulators, policy makers, and private sectors to build an improved fintech ecosystem to support the growth of our fintech markets. This is underpinned by the most advanced regulatory partnership that the FCA has signed, connecting the UK to a market of 24 million people and ensuring stronger commercial ties with Australia’s rapidly growing fintech sector.""

Quorum has become an extremely successful enterprise platform even beyond financial services, and we’re excited about its potential.”The statement has failed to quell speculation that big banks are re-assessing the short-term value of distributed ledger technology as the massive operational overhauls required to implement working applications become clear.Earlier this month, banking co-operative Swift reported back on its own experiments in applying blockchain technology to Nostro reconciliations and noted that translating the proof-of-concept into a workable product would require significant re-engineering. For instance, all account servicers would first need to migrate from batch to real-time liquidity reporting and processing, and back office applications would need to be upgraded to feed the platform with real-time updates.The tests also showed that further progress is needed on the DLT technology itself. For example, just 528 channels were required in the PoC to ensure Nostro accounts would only be stored on the nodes of their account servicers and owners. In order to move to full production, more than 100,000 channels would need to be established and maintained, covering all existing Nostro relationships, presenting significant operational challenges.

	Jun Ying, who was CIO at Equifax’s US Information Solutions, faces charges from both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission after selling nearly a million dollars of stock in his employer before news of the breach became public.According to authorities, last August Ying became aware of information suggesting that Equifax had been hit by hackers. On Friday, 25 August 2017, he texted a co-worker that the breach they were working on “Sounds bad. We may be the one breached.” The following Monday, Ying conducted web searches on the impact of Experian’s 2015 data breach on its stock price. Later that morning, he exercised all of his available stock options held at UBS Financial Services, resulting in him receiving 6,815 shares of Equifax stock, which he then sold, receiving $950,000, realising a gain of over $480,000. On September 7, 2017, Equifax publicly announced its data breach, which affected around 148 million US customers. Shares in the firm, which had been trading at almost $143, fell 18% in the wake of the news. According to the SEC complaint, by selling before public disclosure of the data breach, Ying avoided more than $117,000 in losses.Richard Best, director, Atlanta regional office, SEC, says: ""Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit.”

	The trials of the technology - which requires customers to check-in at an electronic box on their table - comes as Barclaycard releases new research which found that 95% of restauranteurs would prefer their staff to focus on delivering good service, rather than spending time on taking payment. Using Dine & Dash users store their payment details in the app and check in by tapping their phone against a colour-coded electronic totem at their table. Having finished the meal, diners can simply get up and go, with payment automatically taken from their stored credentials. The app applies proximity tracking to sense when users have left the restaurant and releases the table to waiting staff.Diners can also check out in the app where they will have the option to split the bill, add a tip and apply a discount code. All diners can see their bill total in real time and receive a digital receipt via Barclays' partnership with startup Flux.Dine & Dash builds on the ‘invisible payments’ technology Barclaycard trialled in 2017 with Grab + Go. That pilot enabled employees to turn their mobile phones into pocket checkouts to scan and pay for goods in the Barclays’ staff restaurants. Nick Kerigan, managing director of future payments at Barclaycard, says: “Building on our experience in invisible payments, we wanted to use Dine & Dash to unlock a whole host of benefits for restauranteurs: from freeing staff up to focus on customer service to creating a better dining experience that increases loyalty to improving table turnover time - leading to higher revenues.""Dine & Dash is being trialled at the St Martins Lane Avenue Prezzo restaurant in Central London on 13 March.

	Having come together to create the Fintech Innovation Lab back in 2010, Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City have now produced a report trying to gauge how the participating startups and FIs feel about going through the technology onboarding process.The report finds differing perceptions among the 52 lab alumni and 35 FI sponsors (from London, New York and Hong Kong) of what was occuring during four key partnership phases - prospecting, proof-of-concept, procurement and implementation.Says the report: ""Overall, onboarding technology products at financial companies appears complex and under-resourced from the fintech perspective. And while financial institutions are moving to streamline internal processes, fintechs suggest they aren’t as far along as they think they are. ""But fintechs also may not be as sophisticated as other large contractors that are accustomed to working with financial institutions, which means it is sometimes difficult for fintechs to move through the implementation process smoothly.""When it comes to moving from prospecting to PoC, 60% of New York FIs cite regulatory, compliance or security issues as a major stumbling block. Yet less than a fifth of fintechs see a problem in those areas, tending to see lack of budget or competition with internal rivals as a bigger issue.Reasons also diverge on why products stall in the proof of concept phase. New York financial institutions emphasise compliance and security issues as the top cause. Fintechs stress lack of dedicated employees or funding resources, and lack of alignment between use cases and product roadmaps.The groups agree procurement takes too long, with more than 60% saying that the process lasts four to six months. And when it comes to implementation, more than half of respondents agree that security and compliance, and vendor approval processes slow efforts down.The report recommends partners create a map to chart the process, designating a leader for each phase. Decision making should be streamlined and simplified, while sandboxes should be used to facilitate PoCs.

For instance, as an inhouse operation, the treasurers involved were free to break the current boundaries by reading an accurate cash position of another closed treasury location, and perform operations on behalf of these locations on several currencies.Says Toudoire: ""Although it is still too early to determine how the technology will evolve and whether it is suitable for large-scale deployment, our pilot has demonstrated the clear strengths of private blockchain and its potential as one of the most effective ways to improve the existing internal processes between different businesses on an international level.”

(UR), and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, will put UR's server-based 'light palm authentication' technique through its paces.In contrast to the palm vein technology using near-infrared light currently in general use, Universal Robot has made it possible to capture vein patterns with visible light for authentication purposes. This means that authentication can be done with just a smartphone camera.The company claims its technology has the world's highest level of accuracy, with only a 0.0003% possibility of misidentification. The trial at JCB headquarters in Tokyo will focus on capturing customer palm print and vein patterns with a smartphone camera, storing the patterns on a server, performing authentication, and returning the results to the smartphone. JCB says it will be studying how to utilise the technology for a wide variety of services while only requiring the customer to register their palm information in the authentication server once using their own smartphone.

As technology has changed the financial services landscape, venture capitalists, private equity firms, corporates and others have pumped more than $50 billion into nearly 2500 fintech startups since 2010.2015 saw impressive growth, with investment rising by 75% to $22.3 billion but by the end of the year there were signs that the sector was beginning to cool. The recent collapse of Powa and Square's relatively lacklustre IPO has led many to question fintech valuations.Accenture argues that while traditional fintech hotspots such as Silicon Valley and London may have matured and seen investment settle down, other parts of the world - including Austin, Stockholm and Mumbai - have picked up the slack. In particular, Asia Pacific has seen investment soar, quadrupling to $4.3 billion last year. Other signs of a maturing industry are the increase in the number of big-ticket investments, with 94 fintech deals larger than $50 million, and greater diversification away from retail payments to areas such as wealth management and insurance.Accenture also notes that collaborative fintech ventures — those primarily targeting financial institutions as customers — are gaining ground over so-called 'disruptive' players that enter the market to compete against those institutions. This is particularly true in the most mature market, North America.Richard Lumb, group chief executive, financial services, Accenture, says: ""The so-called ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ is a global phenomenon that brings new innovation and digital companies that compete and collaborate with traditional financial services.

	The figures come from an annual study that lists the leading 50 established fintech companies across the globe, and the most intriguing 50 ‘emerging stars’.The rise of the Chinese startup is a standout this year, with Shanghai-based ZhongAn taking the top spot in the 50 Established Innovators list, and Qufengi fourth. Last year WeCash was the only representative from China to appear on the list. This year there are seven Chinese companies in the Fintech 100, reflecting increased venture capital levels and interest in the country's emerging fintech sector.In total. the Fintech 100 includes 40 companies from The Americas, 20 companies from Emea, 18 from the UK, and 22 companies from Asia-Pacific region, including 10 from Australia and NZ.Payments is the sector most at risk of disruption, says KPMG. Startup growth in payments, currencies and transactions sees this segment now representing 25% of the Fintech 100, a substantial uplift on last year.The insurance industry is also beginning to emerge as a hot new market for investment, with the top two companies on the list hailing from this sector, and a total representation of seven firms, compared to none last year.Over a quarter of the cohort are already established as service suppliers to financial institutions, compared to just seven last year, demonstrating increasing levels of collaboration between startups and banks and a shift away from 'disruption' to 'co-creation'. Ian Pollari, global co-lead of KPMG’s fintech practice says: ""It is positive to see the development of the fintech ‘enablers’, which are seeking to provide services and capabilities to financial institutions. This needs to form a core part of how incumbents seek to respond to the threats and opportunities that come from disruption.” He says that ten companies from the emerging list will be invited to attend a KPMG International & Matchi Fintech Summit in London on February 10-11th to pitch their ideas to leading financial institutions, venture capital funds and investors. They will also receive professional services support from KPMG firms, plus membership and discounted deal-success rates with Matchi, the online fintech match-making platform.

	Accenture says the figures are a wake-up call to the local banking community, as large e-commerce conglomerates such as Alibaba flex their financial muscles and push further into traditional financial strongholds. According to the report, the largest share of 2015 Asia-Pacific fintech investment deals were in payments (40%) and lending (25%), which have traditionally been the sole domain of banks.While the volume of deals over the current year is only slight up on 2014, the value has skyrocketed, due to larger investments in and from China. They include investments from Alibaba and its Ant Financial Services Group subsidiary into Paytm, a mobile payment and commerce platform in India, as well as fundraising efforts by Ping An Insurance Group venture Lufax, which has been developing multiple alternative financing and investment platforms, including peer-to-peer and business-to-customer platforms.“Major non-traditional financial services companies have been investing in fintech payments in China for the past year,” says Beat Monnerat, senior managing director at Accenture and the company’s financial services lead in Asia-Pacific. “The increasing deal size should serve as a wake-up call to financial services companies in China and across Asia-Pacific that if they do not offer truly useful, customer-friendly digital solutions, competitors will step into the breach not just on the retail front but also in commercial transactions.”The banks are not entirely resting on their laurels, increasing investments in venture capital funding, incubators and startups and driving through innovations via cloud technology, mobile wallets and blockchain experiments. The release of the report coincides with the second annual investor day for startups who have graduated from Accenture's FinTech Innovation Lab Asia-Pacific, which seeks to further bridge the gap by parading some of the region's most promising startups before an audience of VCs and local banks.“Identifying potential areas for more fintech innovation is a key function of our fintech labs,” says Jon Allaway, senior managing director of Accenture’s financial services group in Asean. “For startups, the opportunity is unparalleled: they get to hear from 12 different banks on what those banks need; for the banks, the mentoring helps them identify solutions that are coming to the market soon that may be able to help them serve their customers better.”

Basing its numbers on investment data from CB Insights that covers VC and PE firms, corporations, hedge funds and government-backed funds, the report says that global spending on fintech soared from just $4.05 billion in 2013.
The US also saw investment triple, up from $3.39 billion in 2013 to $9.89 billion in 2014. This compares to a rise of just 68% between 2012 and 2013. New York saw far more modest growth of 32% to reach $768 million last year.
Payments remains the area attracting most interest, accounting for 29% of all US deals and 54% of the value of deals. Lending is the next most popular segment, while wealth management and trading technology are particularly popular in New York, accounting for 42% of deals in the city.

Accenture predicts that the insurance sector will be a major area ripe for fintech disruption in the future, and cites cloud computing and the blockchain as two big technological trends in the next year.

	While the United States still captures the lion’s share of fintech investment, Europe experienced the highest growth rate, with an increase of 215% to $1.48 billion in 2014. The United Kingdom and Ireland accounted for more than two-fifths (42 percent) of the European total, as investment in the region rose from $264 million in 2013 to $623 million in 2014. In the rest of Europe, the regions that experienced the most significant levels of investment in 2014 were the Nordic countries ($345 million), the Netherlands ($306 million) and Germany ($82 million).Julian Skan, Accenture managing director overseeing the FinTech Innovation Lab London, sees the figures as representing both a threat and an opportunity for established banks. “Fintech is empowering new competitors and start-ups to move into parts of the banking business but, paradoxically, it is also helping banks to create better, more convenient products and services for their clients,"" he says. ""It is also leading to increased cooperation between traditional banks and innovative start-ups and technology businesses in a way that can result in totally new business models and revenue streams.”The report was released at the third annual 'Investor Day' of Accenture's FinTech Innovation Lab London.

The vast majority also believe that they lack the skills and culture needed to succeed in the digital age. In addition, although 80% see working with start-ups as a valuable way to bring new ideas to their business, 56% claim that their organisational cultures need to change in order to work effectively with start-ups.A majority of respondents (72%) expect their banks to increase investment in technology innovation over the next two years. Fifty-six percent say their banks will explore open innovation, such as opening up their intellectual property, assets and expertise to outside innovators to help generate new ideas and discover new areas for growth. Thirty-two percent say their banks will create a corporate venture arm within the next two years. A majority (60%) are also open to sacrificing current revenue in order to move to new business models.

	The statement was made within a special report titled Technological innovation: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) – challenges and opportunities for financial market infrastructures that was published alongside its annual report this week.
In the report the ECB acknowledges the various benefits of DLT, such as the ability to lower back office costs and improve reconcilations by enabling automatic updates of records as well as shortening  settlement cycles and therefore reducing collateral requirements.
Yet the technology does not yet meet the ECB's standards for safety and efficiency, says the report. ""The ECB is open to considering new ways to enhance its market infrastructure. However, any technology-based innovation would have to meet high requirements in terms of safety and efficiency … At this stage of its development, [distributed ledger technology (DLT)] is not mature enough and therefore cannot be used in the Eurosystem's market infrastructure. As DLT-based solutions are constantly evolving, the ECB will continue to monitor developments in this field and explore practical uses for DLT.""
The report's tone is in keeping with the ECB's cautious approach to DLT and mirrors previous statements made by bank executives such as Yves Mersch who highlighted similar concerns over security in a speech in December, and a November briefing note that also pointed to issues around governance and privacy and operational risks such as scalability and interoperability.
This is not to say that the ECB is dismissing the technology. The report states that DLT could play an important role in the administration of Target2Secrities, its pan-European securities settlement platform, as well as helping to achieve its overall aim of ""deeper integration of financial markets"".
To this end, the ECB has created a DLT Task Force to ""bring together market experts on financial innovation and cyber security. Its objective is to avoid any negative consequences of technological innovation regarding the harmonisation and integration of post-trade markets in Europe and to explore the potential of DLT to help remove some of the remaining barriers to a fully integrated post-trade market in Europe"".
The ECB has also launched a joint research project with the Bank of Japan to study the possible use of DLT for market infrastructure services. ""This international collaboration aims to bring greater clarity regarding the impact of new technologies on the global financial ecosystem, as well as to ensure that central banks are adequately prepared"" it states.

	Already well-established in New York and London, the Fintech Innovation Lab offers startups the chance to participate in a 12 week programme designed to help them accelerate their product development and gain exposure to industry bigwigs.
Asia Pacific-based firms working in areas such as big data and analytics, mobile and wireless, payments, risk management, security, and social media, can apply during July to take part in the Hong Kong programme.
The applicants will then be whittled down by a panel of bank executives to seven participants. These will make their way to Hong Kong in September for 12 weeks of mentoring by banking executives who will help them fine-tune and develop their technologies and business strategies through a series of workshops, panel discussions, user-group sessions, networking opportunities, one-on-one meetings and presentations.
The programme culminates in December with an investor day presentation by participants in front of an audience of financial industry executives and potential investors.
Sushil Saluja, senior MD, Asia Pacific financial services practice, Accenture, says: ""Hong Kong's role as a regional hub for the banking industry and the gateway for China investment made it an ideal location to launch our new Asia-Pacific Lab. By fostering the development of the next generation of financial technology companies, the Lab will further strengthen Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading financial capitals.""
The banks backing the event are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bank of China (Hong Kong), Barclays, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Ping An and UBS.

The study of 109 global banks totted up the number of directors with either senior technology experience at a company (such as Chief Information Officer) or senior experience (such as a non-executive directorship) at a technology company and found that just 6% fulfilled this criteria.“If your main competition now comes from financial technology companies and not banks and the biggest threat you face is cyber security, then technology has become so ingrained in your business that you really need to know something about it,” said Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture, speaking to the Financial Times (FT).The US and the UK scored highest in terms of proportion of directors with technology experience with 15.7% and 14.3%  respectively.

	Having taken a reputational hammering during the economic crisis and facing the threat of competition from technology giants such as Google and Facebook, as well as new, nimble financial services-related start-ups, earlier this year AIB decided to completely change its approach to innovation.The bank set itself a deadline to build a mortgage processing mobile app from scratch in 13 weeks, COO Anne Boden told MarketForce's 'future of retail banking' conference in London.By ditching big formal meetings and sitting down business and technology employees together, AIB managed to get a plan for the app together within three weeks and have it ready for customer testing after 45 days ahead of its launch just another 20 days later.Boden says that the fruits of their labour is an app that slashes the time it takes for customers to go through the mortgage process from up to 10 days to less than a minute. The start-up culture is about more than being quick, Boden says, it is also about breaking free of the bank's long-held prejudices. In contrast to technology companies, banks, she argues, have a tendency to try to work around big issues and problems, rather than tackling them head on.When the possibility of an account opening app was floated at AIB, the assumption was that it could not be rolled out because regulations require customers to talk to a bank representative face-to-face.However, when AIB went to Ireland's central bank to check, it found that no such rule is in place, it had always just been presumed so. An app was built, letting new customers open an account from their phone in 10 minutes.Boden argues that banks that for many years were able to be complacent over customer retention now have to be quick and agile if they want to survive, giving customers want they want, when they want it at a price they want if they want to survive. Other banks have taken a similar approach: Barclays established a start-up culture when building its hugely successful Pingit app in just 90 days before throwing it out to customers and then tweaking it based on feedback gathered via social media.

Venture capital investment in London fintech has rocketed from £24m in the whole of 2010 to £312m in the first six months of this year alone. While investment is increasing, the EY data shows that wealthy young Brits are warming to new models for saving and spending in P2P, mobile and investment. In the last six months, 35% of the United Kingdom’s online population has used at least one emergent fintech product, says EY, and people’s usage increases in line with their income.

Crucially we estimate that as much as 20 per cent is generated from the high growth ""emergent"" fintech segment including online payments, online security and marketplace lending. We think there’s potential for the UK fintech industry to generate an additional £16bn of revenues by 2020.”The figures have been seized on by the Mayoral delegation in Japan as further evidence of London's status as a fintech powerhouse in Europe.

	The appointment was buried in an 88-page document published by Chancellor George Osborne detailing measures to boost the UK's productivity.Passion Capital has been an active investor in the UK's burgeoning fintech scene, with stakes in early-stage startups such as Coinfloor, Birdback, GoCardless and putative challenger bank Mondo.News of Burbidge's elevated status comes just days after the Mayor of London's promotional arm released figures showing venture capital investment into Britain’s technology companies has hit a record high of nearly $1.5bn during the first six months of this year, with London-based fintech firms leading the charge.Commenting on the data, Burbidge - who moved to the UK from Silicon valley in 2004 as an early employee of Skype - says: “Last year it took London tech firms nine months to reach the billion dollar mark, this year they’ve done it in six months. The city has become such a tech powerhouse because it excels over other tech hubs around the world.

	The figures, released by London & Partners, the Mayor’s promotional company, show the capital's technology companies scooping up the lion's share of VC investment by securing more than 80% of the total funding and 70% of all deals. This in turn has been driven by the buzz around fintech-based startups, with firms like Funding Circle, Azimo, WorldRemit and Currency Cloud raising $472million - equivalent to 40% of the total amount raised in London.Peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle secured the largest deal of the last three month by raising $150m in April. The company is now valued at more than $1bn. Samir Desai, CEO and co-founder of Funding Circle says: “London continues to be a fantastic place to grow a financial technology company. In just five years, the Funding Circle marketplace has become the fifth largest net lender to small businesses. The money we raised in April will allow us to go on to create a sustainable, category-defining business in a multi-billion dollar global market.”His words are echoed by Passion Capital's Eileen Burbidge, who says: “Last year it took London tech firms nine months to reach the billion dollar mark, this year they’ve done it in six months. The city has become such a tech powerhouse because it excels over other tech hubs around the world. London combines the technology and digital innovation of Silicon Valley with the Wall Street financing heritage of New York and the policy making of Washington DC - all in one phenomenal city.”VC investment into UK tech firms during the first six months of 2015 eclipsed the same period in 2014 when firms raised just over $1bn and are hundreds of millions of dollars higher than the full 12 month totals from 2010-13. The data comes after research from GP Bullhound revealed that Britain has 17 tech unicorns commanding $1 billion-plus valuations with 13 in the capital.Lower down the scale, London’s army of budding fintech startups are also continuing to secure record levels of funding. DoPay, a company that graduated from the Barclay’s Tech Stars accelerator programme last year and which allows people who’re excluded from the traditional banking system get access to financial services, successfully raised $2.4m in two separate deals during the last three months. Frans van Eersel, CEO of DoPay said: “Access to this kind of early-stage funding is crucial for companies like us. The money will allow us to push ahead with our growth across Egypt and expand into new markets across West Africa.”

It offers up 24 ways in which the next government can make the country a ""world leader in digital innovation"".
Fintech players, including TransferWise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, Funding Circle CEO Samir Desai, MarketInvoice chief Anil Stocker and GoCardless's Hiroki Takeuchi, have put their names to the manifesto and their influence can be seen in one of the 24 recommendations: ""Continue to support fintech innovation.""
The document welcomes the efforts of the UK Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority, noting Chancellor George Osborne's warm words for the fintech industry at the recent launch of Innovate Finance.
The next government should look to tackle barriers to innovation, says the manifesto, particularly by ensuring that HMRC becomes ""one of the first tax authorities to establish a framework relating to tax, VAT and other compliance requirements related to cryptocurrency"".
In addition, the government should look at anti-money laundering and know your customer rules and how they affect digital businesses, particularly as we move to a world of digital proofs and secure online identity assurance.
More generally, the manifesto calls on the return of tax relief for corporate venture capital, changes to the visa system to boost access to talent, investment in digital infrastructure, and a commitment to open data.
Gerard Grech, CEO, Tech City UK, says: ""By shinning a spotlight on the key priorities for digital businesses, we can work together to support the needs of Britain's entrepreneurs and the continued growth of the UK's technology sector.""

The gateway - to be rolled out late next year - is the second building block in the Hong Kong bourse's Orion programme, a massive US$380 million, three year, tech overhaul.The gateway will offer brokers the choice of a binary interface or standard FIX 5.0 option, and will introduce several new features such as a drop copy service. The system is designed to simplify HKEx's market access architecture, with brokers able to reduce infrastructure costs to access securities market systems by consolidating telecoms circuits and eliminating physical hardware in their premises.To enable firms to migrate at their own pace, the new gateway will be introduced in parallel with HKEx's existing access infrastructure, and the current architecture will remain in operation until at least 2015.Julian Ragless, SVP, platform development and strategy, HKEx, says: ""In evaluating service providers, we applied a stringent set of requirements in terms of performance and functionality.

Far from resisting it, banks should be embracing these fundamental changes, says Oliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS. 
	There is no doubt that, thanks to advances in digital technologies, the financial industry is entering a period of radical change. Transaction and settlement, savings and lending, capital raising, investment management, market provisioning: it is difficult to find any area of banking that is not being disrupted by the current wave of digitalisation. With the rise of virtual banks, crowdfunding, alternative payment platforms, robo-advisors and the like, digitalisation is also spawning significant new competition for incumbent institutions. In light of these developments, some have been predicting the demise of traditional banks. This is overstating the case. Digital disruption is by no means only a threat. Quite the contrary, it is spurring industry innovation in a number of very positive ways. It is also encouraging collaboration among industry participants, driving cultural change. Today’s banks are reaching outside their walls, working with startups, joining innovation platforms and collaborating on new ideas in ways that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. They are also collaborating more internally, for example by using social media-like tools to promote direct communication and the sharing of ideas among staff. UBS and startups - learning from each otherInspired by the “permission-to-fail” culture found in startups, banks are becoming much more open to experimentation as well. This is certainly the case at UBS. We have put a strong innovation process in place, one which generates lots of ideas internally and has clear gates to let in good ideas from the outside. We also work closely with the technology community in our innovation labs in Zurich, London and Singapore.By taking our people out of the bank and immersing them in a lab environment, we give them space to think creatively. We also give them the freedom to make mistakes. In this way we can generate - and test - a far greater number of interesting ideas than would otherwise be the case. In London we have opened our lab in a fintech accelerator, sharing space with some 150 startups engaged in researching and developing new products and services for the financial industry. This lets our experts be part of the larger conversation, staying on top of developments and helping to shape our industry’s future. Far from being enemies, fintechs are very much part of our conscious endeavor to embrace change. While some are looking to compete directly, in our experience the majority of fintechs are more interested in collaborating with banks. After all, there is more to banking than just bits and bytes. Banks are a storehouse of financial and market expertise of the kind most fintechs lack. Banking also remains very much a relationship business, and here too fintechs have much to learn.For these and other reasons, we are confident that banks will not be going away any time soon. In our opinion, digital disruption should not be seen as a danger, but rather a healthy challenge, driving change and opening up exciting new possibilities. With this in mind, we also feel it is imperative for the Swiss financial center to promote a strong fintech ecosystem. Only with close cooperation between the country’s banks, its fintech startups and the regulator will Switzerland be able to keep pace with today’s strong global competition.

Thanks to it, customers may order EKUZ cards (European Health Insurance Card), file an application for ID card or driving license, notify the sale of a car, obtain copies of birth, marriage or death certificates or register their business activity. They may also freely use all the functions of the PUE ZUS service (social insurance), quickly obtain a criminal record certificate or an individual tax interpretation. What's more important, they get the possibility to affix electronic signature to applications and official letters.PKO Bank Polski was the first to join the project ""From paper to digital Poland"", which is a part of the Plan for Responsible Development led by Ministry of Development. The bank's customers may already file “500+ applications” (social benefits) and log to the PUE ZUS, and from now on, they are able to create Trusted Profiles in their transaction service. The created Profile allows to log in and sign electronically applications and forms on selected public administration sites. This takes place similarly to the quick payments in e-stores - the bank authenticates the provided customer's data and then re-logs the customer to the selected service or allows to confirm the submitted instruction or application. At the same time, at no point data are exchanged between the authority and the bank, thus making the process safe and confidential. - By providing commercial entities with trusted profile set-up tools, citizens will no more have to confirm their identity with an authorized public administration unit. That will make the trusted profile itself more accessible to people - says Mrs Anna Strezynska, Minister of Digital Affairs. - This is a game-changer in the approach towards digital services and digitization.

Today we change it all as the Trusted Profile is now ready to be completed remotely, e.g. with a bank’s on-line interface - assures Mrs Strezynska.  We are a technology leader in the banking sector. We have the experience, unique to the market, in creating user-friendly and safe solutions, recognized both by the market and the users.

	The country's new Payments Council has set up an industry task force made up of banks, payment schemes, QR service providers and government agencies to put together standardised specifications for the code by the end of the year.The council argues that QR codes offer a cheaper and less infrastructure-heavy alternative to debit and credit card schemes, making them more feasible for smaller cash-based merchants.But to avoid the fragmentation caused by several proprietary QR codes, a common scheme is needed. In April local banks DBS and OCBC revealed plans to introduce QR code-based payments at offline stores in a joint project with national payments processor Nets.The new taskforce will set out specifications to accept both domestic and international payment schemes as well as outline a governance structure and implementation strategy.Yeo Hiang Meng, member, Payments Council and president of the Federation of Merchants’ Association, Singapore, says: ""Singaporeans are interested in the mobile payment experience. FMAS will work with the MAS, Association of Banks in Singapore and financial institutions to expedite the adoption of the common QR code for mobile payments.""Meanwhile, at its inaugural meeting, the Payments Council also called for improvements to the PayNow P2P money transfer service.

The acquisition, for a sum yet to be disclosed, would be funded through Morgan Stanley on behalf of Urban FT’s principal investor.The rescue bid comes after a rash of bad news for Digiliti Money, which last week installed a new CEO amid warnings that it expected to post second quarter revenues of between $1.1 million and $1.3 million, compared to $2 million in Q2 2016. The firm has since applied for an extension with the Securities and Exchange Commission to finalise its results statement for Q2 after its accountants said that consolidated financial statements for 2016 could no longer be relied upon. Urban FT has past experience in closing and integrating bolt-on acquisitions, from its 2015 takeover of Wipit to last month's buy out of mobile banking tech firm iParse. The company has made known its appetite for additional acquisitions of transactional banking operators and providers of mobile, Web or other B2B services that serve community and regional financial institutions.“Our goal in approaching Digiliti Money with an attractive and timely offer is to keep the business operating and viable as we consolidate the entities to leverage the savings from operational synergies,” says Urban FT COO Glen Fossella. “We believe that our cash offer—with the option for certain shareholders, at their discretion, to convert their Digiliti Money common stock to Urban FT common stock—represents the best benefit to all parties involved, most particularly the consumers who rely on the services of Digiliti Money’s clients.""

	In a speech at the British Library extolling the virtues of fintech, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Harriett Baldwin emphasised the importance not just of backing firms in the sector, but investing in skills, research and development.
The blockchain has emerged as the hottest fintech niche, with startups and major banks all investing in the technology as they seek to cut costs and improve efficiency in areas such as retail payments and post-trade services.
The government has now committed an extra £10 million to investigate the blockchain, bringing together the Research Councils, Alan Turing Institute and Digital Catapult with industry, in order to address the research opportunities and challenges.
In her speech, Baldwin reiterated George Osborne's stated aim of making the UK the world's leading fintech centre, claiming that it employs some 135,000 people in the country and that ""our GDP was £20 billion greater as a result of the sector’s activities,"" in 2014.
The minister (who recently talked to Finextra) says that efforts to set up a new regulatory regime for digital currencies are already bearing fruit, winning overseas investors and convincing firms such as Circle to set up shop in the UK.
Another fintech firm tempted to the country is Lend2Fund, an Australian marketplace lender for commercial property deals, which has decided to relocate to London.
The startup was one of 10 Oz fintech firms that visited London last month as part of a trade delegation. Now it has decided to make a move, citing a better regulatory regime and better support system for young firms looking to take on the banking industry.
Company co-founder Paul Missio, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""Australia can't match the powerhouse of London for a fintech company that has global ambitions. The UK nurtures fintech for global scale but we aren't seeing a cohesive 'global' vision in Australia.
""In London, there is a greater support for emerging fintech start-ups like ours, on all levels, from government, capital markets, through to those simply wishing to provide advice and mentorship.""

	Last summer Osborne vowed to use the government's powers to help make Britain a hub for financial technology innovation and commissioned a report to investigate the enblers and barriers that will shape the fintech sector over the next 10 years.The report has now been published, recommending the creation of a 'fintech advisory group' with representation from government, regulators, trade associations, academia and business. This body would coordinate strategy and provide a neutral forum for dialogue.The government should also create a programme of 'grand challenges' for the fintech industry to tackle, in areas such as machine learning, digital currencies, big data, and mobile payments.Research councils and Innovate UK should be used to support research into fintech areas, helping to ensure academics have access to world-class data sets. Meanwhile fintech modules should be included in relevant degree courses, says the report.Another recommendation is the creation of regional hubs to help spread fintech's benefits beyond London. In the budget today, Osborne took the first step towards this, promising to fund an incubator in Leeds.The state should also put its money where its mouth is by being an ""expert strategic commissioner"" of fintech, helping to create 'laboratories' for testing new business models. Related to this, the report calls for a system to be developed and overseen by financial regulators, that allows new ideas to be piloted, and new technologies to be tested in virtual and real situations.In the budget, Osborne said that the FCA's ‘Project Innovate’ will work with HMT and the Prudential Regulation Authority to investigate the feasibility of developing a regulatory ‘sandbox’ for financial services innovators.Osborne also tasked the FCA and PRA with responding to another of the report's recommendations: the creation of a state-of-the art regulatory reporting and analytics infrastructure, dubbed ‘RegTech’.
